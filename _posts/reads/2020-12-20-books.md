Books I've read, ordered chronologically. See my top reads from [2022](/reads/top-reads-2022/),
[2021](/reads/top-reads-2021), [2020](/reads/top-reads-2020), and [2019](/reads/top-reads-2019).

I've always been a reader, mostly voracious and other times...not so much (parenthood will do
that to you). I finally started keeping track of what I was reading after one-too-many times
where I bought a book, got a few chapters in, and realized I had already read it years before.
Oops. Here's the list, going all the way back to 2011. 

* Books I really enjoyed are marked with two plus signs. ++
* <i>Graphic novels & comics are italicized.</i>
* Books I didn't finish are marked as [abandoned](#abandoned).

I also use [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/todhilton).

# 2023

1. [Tranquility by Tuesday: 9 Ways to Calm the Chaos and Make Time for What Matters](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780593419007), by Laura Vanderkam ++
   <details><summary>Realistic and practical...</summary>Realistic and practical advice from Laura Vanderkam, as I expected. I've read other books of hers and they all provide exactly that in a succinct and entertaining writing style. I'm grateful for how she breaks down the topic of managing your time—and accompanying sense of being overwhelmed—into bite-sized chunks that make sense and are easy to work on individually. These individual chunks can add up to significant change, if you take the time to implement them.<br><br></details>
1. _[Giant Days (Vol. 1)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781608867899), by John Allison, Whitney Cogar, & Lissa Treiman_ ++
   <details><summary>A thoroughly fun...</summary>A thoroughly fun, quirky, and enjoyable story of 3 young women's friendships and adventures during their college (university) years. It had me nostalgic for my college days, not only the adventures similar to theirs, but the ones that were different and unique from mine. For those yet to attend university, here's a taste of what it can be like and a reminder to be courageous, find those friendships and experiences that will be the building blocks of adulthood!<br><br>Note for the 'Extra Credit' and 'Early Registration' volumes: They're still good, but not quite as much so as the original volumes 1-14. You can read them anytime, but I recommend finishing at least volume 1 of the primary/main track first.<br><br></details>

1. [The Simple Path to Wealth](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781533667922), by JL Collins
   <details><summary>I appreciate the simplicity...</summary>I appreciate the simplicity of the author's concept along with the real-world evidence that supports it. I've been investing this way for years because of the simplicity and low cost, it's nice to see all of the research that confirms my decision. This book makes the topic of investing and saving accessible to everyone. In fact, the book could be summarized in a page or two, if that's all you really want or need, but the author takes the time to explain the history and reasoning behind their approach in ways that make sense to everyone, even those who don't have a financial or investing background (like the author's daughter, who it was initially written for).<br><br></details>
1. [Laws of Depravity (Martyr Maker #1)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781728261003), by Eriq La Salle
   <details><summary>Wrapping up theology and morality...</summary>Wrapping up theology and morality in the chase to catch a serial killer, La Salle does a tremendous job with the tale and the characters. The book is only a mystery for the first half, then the killer is revealed and it becomes more about the chase, although he still manages to throw in several surprises up until the very end. I particularly appreciate the depth he provides for each of the characters, giving the reader interesting and pertinent backstories. Thoroughly enjoyed and looking forward to the next in the series.<br><br></details>
1. [The Underground Railroad](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780345804327), by Colson Whitehead
   <details><summary>It feels odd...</summary>It feels odd to say that I enjoyed this book when it deals with such a horrific topic. Yet, Whitehead does a wonderful job telling the tale, weaving together the various characters, and reimagining the metaphorical underground railroad into a real tunnel-based system running through the country. He portrays slavery in all of its horrors and obviously did extensive research on its many facets. That's why I can't really say I enjoyed the book, but it definitely kept me engaged and wanting to know how Cora handled each (mostly tragic) situation.<br><br></details>
1. [They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780300251838), by Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers ([abandoned](#abandoned))
   <details><summary>Interesting historical information...</summary>Interesting historical information about the slave-owning white women of the antebellum South, most of which I was unfamiliar with. It's vastly apparent that the author did extensive research, providing citations for nearly every accounting. I truly appreciate that she centered the enslaved peoples' accounts, versus the whitewashed records most of us grew up with, if we learned about it at all. Having said that, I found the writing repetitive; it lacked an evolving narrative that guided the reader and was dry, like studying a text book. I finished 25% of the book before deciding to stop reading.<br><br></details>
1. [Finding Me: A Memoir](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780063037366), by Viola Davis
   <details><summary>I had no idea...</summary>I had no idea about Viola Davis' childhood: extreme poverty, physically abusive father, emotionally unavailable mother, surrounded by blatant racism, and full of courage (even when she didn't realize it in the moments). This was a fascinating journey with Viola as she examines her evolution into who she is today. I've always enjoyed her as an actor and now I have the utmost of respect and appreciation for her as a person.<br><br></details>
1. [Black Cop's Kid](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C66SKLH), by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ++
   <details><summary>I'm consistently impressed...</summary>I'm consistently impressed with Abdul-Jabbar's knowledge, empathy, sincerity, and candor in his writing and this long-form essay has all of those things. He explains how his relationship with his father, a NYC cop, impacted and inspired his life-long pursuit of social justice, even though they didn't speak about it. Abdul-Jabbar discusses the paradox of being a Black police officer, wanting to help others while participating in a broken system. Highly recommend subscribing to his <a href="https://kareem.substack.com/">newsletter</a>.<br><br></details>
1. [Legendborn (Book 1): Legendborn](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534441613), by Tracy Deonn ++
   <details><summary>A fantastic Arthurian-inspired tale...</summary>A fantastic Arthurian-inspired tale of a Black teenage girl from North Carolina who finds herself entrenched in a prophecy that she didn't know about and definitely didn't want to be a part of. Deonn builds a uniquely interesting world around the Legends of King Arthur, full of complexity and intrigue with characters that grow and adapt with the story. I sincerely appreciate how Deonn presents Bree, the main character, and the many experiences that are unique precisely because she's a young Black woman who often has to deal with microaggressions and racism.<br><br></details>
1. [Legendborn (Book 2): Bloodmarked](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534441637), by Tracy Deonn ++
   <details><summary>This second book...</summary>This second book in the Legendborn series continues the tale of a Black teenage girl from North Carolina, Bree, who finds herself entrenched in an Arthurian-inspired prophecy. Deonn continues to build on and explain the complexities of the magical world around Bree. There were several unexpected plot twists and the characters continue to evolve in interesting ways. Once again, I appreciate Deonn's tie-ins to the history of enslaved people in the U.S. and how it continues to impact our culture. She integrates that history into the storyline with depth, care, and respect.<br><br></details>
1. [Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780393347777), by Charles Wheelan ++
   <details><summary>Wheelan brings brevity and clarity...</summary>Wheelan brings brevity and clarity to a tedious subject matter, statistical analysis. This is nothing like the textbook for my statistics class in college, which might be why I actually read this one cover-to-cover. Wheelan adeptly translates advanced concepts into real-world situations using clear language and intuitive examples.  I found the silly sense of humor enjoyable, but I can see where it might bother some folks. All in all, I found it informative and often enjoyable to read, which given the subject matter is a formidable accomplishment, one to be lauded!<br><br>"Statistics is like a high-caliber weapon: helpful when used correctly and potentially disastrous in the wrong hands."<br><br></details>
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 0.5): The Assassin's Blade - Prequel Novellas](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639731091), by Sarah J. Maas
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 1): Throne of Glass](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639730957), by Sarah J. Maas
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 2): Crown of Midnight](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639730971), by Sarah J. Maas
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 3): Heir of Fire](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639730995), by Sarah J. Maas
1. _[Harley Quinn #28](https://a.co/d/bcEfZRr), by Tini Howard, Sweeney Boo, & Erica Henderson_
   <details><summary>A fun, lighthearted, and conflict-filled romp...</summary>A fun, lighthearted, and conflict-filled romp around Gotham with Harley Quinn, where she experiences some consequences for her fight-first-think-later decisions. Admittedly, I primarily read this because I've been a big fan of the artist, <a href="https://www.sweeneyboo.com/">Sweeney Boo</a>, for several years now. When she announced that she was drawing the latest storyline, I put in an order at my local comic shop.<br><br></details>
1. _[The Librarian of Auschwitz: The Graphic Novel](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250842985), by Salva Rubio, Antonio Iturbe, Lilit Žekulin Thwaites, & Loreto Aroca_
   <details><summary>This is a tale that must still be told...</summary>This is a tale that must still be told because some are too eager to forget the horrors of an authoritarian regime. I enjoyed this representation of Dita's story. While it's horrifyingly sad, it's also inspiring to see Dita's persistence and determination throughout her imprisonment. The art in the graphic novel is well done and represents the situations accurately, without overemphasizing or downplaying the violence and horror present. For a sobering story, this is a wonderful interpretation.<br><br></details>
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 4): Queen of Shadows](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639731015), by Sarah J. Maas
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 6): Tower of Dawn](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639731053), by Sarah J. Maas
1. _[Scurry](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534324367), by Mac Smith_
   <details><summary>The art is incredible...</summary>The art is incredible and the story is intriguing, with many allegories to (and warnings for) our modern world.<br><br></details>
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 5): Empire of Storms](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639731039), by Sarah J. Maas
1. [Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250758040), by Melanie Mitchell
   <details><summary>Insightful observations about the history...</summary>Insightful observations about the history and evolution of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry over the last several decades. Mitchell does a fine job turning what can be pretty dry material into relatable and understandable stories that explain how we got to the current state of affairs (in 2019, when the book was published).<br><br>My big takeaway is that since the 1940's, the experts grandiose predictions are quite hand-wavy, ambiguous, and rarely come true. For example, in 1965, Nobel laureate Herbert Simon predicted, "Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work that a man can do." This is referred to as generative artificial intelligence and considered how to simulate human consciousness and deciphering context with computers. In 2023, this is still not possible, not even close.<br><br>What has come true is that AI, specifically machine learning, has been used to solve very specific challenges, such as identifying and reproducing language in large language models (LLM). This is extraordinary, but it's also done within defined boundaries, which is the rub. In order to develop generative AI, those boundaries need to disappear or be expanded exponentially. Mitchell provides many interesting examples of this conundrum, helping to put a realistic lens on what we can expect from artificial intelligence. She doesn't provide predictions of her own, only [realistic] opinions on the predictions others have made.<br><br></details>

# Abandoned

Books I didn't finish are marked as [abandoned](#abandoned).

Why didn't I finish the book? I like to read one book at a time and years ago it took me
months to slug my way through [a book](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1938583995?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1)
that everyone kept telling me "keep reading, it gets better, you'll love it." Nope, didn't
love it...or even like it. Lesson learned. If I don't enjoy a book within the first 30-50
pages, I stop reading it. There are way too many amazing [authors and books out there](https://sketchplanations.com/3500-lifetime-reads)
in the world for me to enjoy, not to mention my lengthy to-read list
([tsundoku](https://sketchplanations.com/tsundoku)).

<p align="center">
<a href="https://sketchplanations.com/tsundoku"><img src="/images/tsundoku-sketchplanations.jpg" alt="Jono Hey of Sketchplanations describes tsundoku - the act of acquiring books and letting them pile up without reading them. In the drawn picture, a smiling person lies in a bedroom on a bed surrounded by books stacked on the bed, the floor, and two shelves affixed to the wall."></a>
