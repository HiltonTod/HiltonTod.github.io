Books I've read, ordered chronologically. See my top reads from [2023](/reads/top-reads-2023/),

I've always been a reader, mostly voracious and other times...not so much (parenthood will do
that to you). I finally started keeping track of what I was reading after one-too-many times
where I bought a book, got a few chapters in, and realized I had already read it years before.
Oops. Here's the list, going all the way back to 2011. 

* Books I really enjoyed are marked with two plus signs. ++
* <i>Graphic novels & comics are italicized.</i>
* Books I didn't finish are marked as [abandoned](#abandoned).

# 2024

1. [Subpar Parks](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780593185544), by Amber Share ++
   <details><summary>Not what I expected...</summary>Not what I expected, but an enjoyable and informative read with an artist's unique take on the poor (low-star) reviews. First of all, I really enjoy the artist's minimalist, two-dimensional style—it's an aesthetic that I appreciate and <a href="https://ambersharedesign.com">Amber Share</a> does it well. Regarding my expectations, I thought the book would be a sarcastic, comedic lambasting of the bad reviews. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the author keeps the sarcasm to a minimum and puts their energy into a brief (one-to-two-page) description of each of the national parks. Share discusses each park's history, origination, indigenous peoples, highlights to look for when visiting, tips and tricks—such as alternatives to the popular crowded areas—and recommendations from the local rangers. The author readily admits that the book is not a thorough guide and advises readers to do their homework before visiting—emphasizing this repeatedly. All in all, Subpar Parks is a lovely introduction to the national parks available in the U.S.!<br><br>You can find more of Amber's work at <a href="https://ambersharedesign.com">ambersharedesign.com</a> and excerpts from the book on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/subparparks">Instagram</a>.<br><br></details>
1. [Making Learning Whole](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780470633717), by David Perkins
1. [Be Useful](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780593655955), by Arnold Schwarzenegger ([abandoned](#abandoned))
   <details><summary>It was interesting, but not enough so to keep me engaged...</summary>It was interesting, but not enough so to keep me engaged (I stopped reading at 20%). His writing is casual and comfortable. It's easy to hear it in his unique voice and feel like he's sitting next to you, sharing the wisdom earned over his 76 years. It's all valuable stuff, just not anything I need at this stage in my life; they're lessons I've already lived through. For many, I'm sure this will be a great read, but for me it wasn't...useful.<br><br></details>
1. [Laws of Annilihation (Martyr Maker #3)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781728261065), by Eriq La Salle
   <details><summary>Third in the series...</summary>Third in the series, Eriq La Salle throws a few curveballs into the longer story arc while maintaining the grittiness of these police procedurals. It takes a different direction from what I anticipated at the end of <strong>Laws of Wrath</strong>, but he deftly ties it together at the end, setting up the next book. While the crimes can be gruesome, the protagonists are interesting, the investigations are intriguing, and the story keeps you engaged.<br><br></details>
1. [Crucial Conversations](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781260474183), by Al Switzler, Emily Gregory, Ron McMillan, Kerry Patterson, & Joseph Grenny
   <details><summary>Insightful [not so] common sense...</summary>Insightful [not so] common sense that boils down successful crucial conversations to the free flow of information. Safety is the key to doing this and when we feel unsafe or threatened, we often resort to silence or violence. With silence, we're so shocked or upset we don't know what to do or say. With violent responses, we're so mad or angry that we lash out. I can relate to both.<br><br><strong>Crucial Conversation</strong> (krōō shel kän`ver sa` shen) - n. A discussion between two or more people where (1) stakes are high, (2) opinions vary, and (3) emotions run strong.<br><br>The authors have provided a well-organized and fairly succinct process for readers to follow. They walk the reader through how to focus on what you really want, notice when safety is at risk, sincerely help participants—including yourself—return to a feeling of safety, speak persuasively in these interactions, and turn them into actions and results.<br><br>It's a fairly quick read and I can see myself revisiting it in the future to refresh my memory and reinforce the lessons.<br><br></details> 
1. [Upgrade](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780593157527), by Blake Crouch ++
   <details><summary>A fast-paced, action-packed, twisty-plot sci-fi...</summary>A fast-paced, action-packed, twisty-plot sci-fi novel set ~50 years in the future. It's a fun, exciting, and sometimes thought-provoking story that kept me turning the pages.<br><br>I received this book from a co-worker for Jólabókaflóð (<a href="https://sketchplanations.com/jolabokaflod">yule book flood</a>), a charming Icelandic tradition of giving books as gifts, opening them on Christmas Eve, and settling in to read them together, ideally with hot chocolate of other warm wintry drink.<br><br></details>
1. [Exit Interview](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780374600907), by Kristi Coulter ++
   <details><summary>Morbid curiosity drove me...</summary>Morbid curiosity drove me to read this and Coulter's witty, insightful commentary captivated me as I watched the proverbial train wreck unfold. I've been working in the Seattle tech community since 1999 and have heard plenty of horror stories about Amazon from friends and associates. This was a front row seat to Kristi's 12 years of experiences at Amazon and how they impacted all aspects of her life.<br><br>Coulter is a wonderful writer. She's snarky, witty, and irreverent, but it's her authenticity and sincerity that pull it all together so well. So many excellently hilarious quotes—especially for those of us who live in Seattle or work in technology!<br><br><em>"The beginning of the process of backing the Jetta out of the driveway. The house is on a busy street [in Ravenna] and it's as if all the other drivers took a blood oath that I can go fuck myself."</em><br><br>Truth.<br><br>One thing that struck me was how much Amazon relies on employees' insecurities and sense of imposter syndrome <sup>1</sup> to foster an inequitable and unrealistic culture. The culture demands overachieving, equating it with success; anything less is considered failure in the eyes of managers and peers, even if you meet the expectations of your job. If you're not striving towards promotion, reaching that next level, going above and beyond mere expectations then the implication is that you're not good enough to be there. You're taking up space that could be filled by someone who is more competent. Nobody really says it out loud or to your face, but it's a result of the system and culture.<br><br>To be honest, this overachieving attitude is rampant in the tech industry. I've experienced it throughout my career (the experience depends heavily on your management and organization), but according to Coulter's description they turn it up to eleven at Amazon and it's a clusterfuck.<br><br><em>"I understand that at Amazon normal human limits are an embarrassing affliction like IBS or erectile dysfunction, not to be discussed in public."</em><br><br><em>"Amazon didn’t create our yearning for recognition, but it exploits it for maximum return by holding the rat pellet just out of reach and then frowning on any rat who looks hungry."</em><br><br>I truly appreciate that Coulter highlights her experience as a woman, something she could have easily foregone in an attempt to be more palatable. She encountered all of the misogynistic and sexist tropes you'd expect, plus a few you wouldn't. Her descriptions are sobering yet hilarious lessons for any man who happens to be paying attention.<br><br><em>"It took me a couple of months to notice something lumpy about Amazon’s demographics. When I’m in a room with people beneath me in level, like the merchandisers, a solid third of them are women. But when I’m with my peers or senior leaders, men usually outnumber women at least three to one. And if it’s a meeting of developers and other tech employees, it’s a brofest at all levels. Both my ceiling and my floor are made of glass."</em><br><br><em>"Just three Gen X women scrambling to make it clear that we would never make waves over a harmless workplace cum-ingestion joke, but these kids today: they’re soft; we must protect them."</em><br><br>This is a witty and relatable memoir about hating your job while also feeling compelled to pursue superhuman unrealistic expectations.<br><br><sup>1</sup>Interesting note, "imposter syndrome" was originally described as "imposter phenomenon" by Dr. Pauline Clance and Dr. Suzanne Imes in their 1978 research paper, <a href="https://www.paulineroseclance.com/pdf/ip_high_achieving_women.pdf">The Imposter Phenomenon in High Achieving Women.</a><br><br></details>
1. _[Spectators](https://explodinggiraffe.substack.com/p/spectators-the-first-200-pages), by Brian K. Vaughan, Niko Henrichon, & Steven Finch (aka Fonografiks)_
   <details><summary>This graphic novel may not...</summary>"This graphic novel may not be for you!" A warning from the author, Brian K. Vaughan, that is certainly true. The concept is intriguing: some people hang around in spectral form after they die and watch the living, nothing else, only watch. They're spectators. The story is viscerally violent in some moments (sometimes a bit much for me) and extremely sexual in others, while delving into what happens to society in the nearish future (~50 years).<br><br>Spectators focuses mostly on the twisted folks and that should give you a hint of what to expect. I like Henrichon's art, which has a strong sketch-like quality to it for this title. Vaughan is one of my favorite graphic novelists (Saga, Paper Girls, and Y: The Last Man) and that was enough for me to give this a try. The story is available for free online and released weekly by the creators at <a href="https://explodinggiraffe.substack.com/">explodinggiraffe.substack.com</a>. I'll keep reading it and see where it goes, but it's also one that I might drop at some point before they wrap it up.<br><br></details>
1. [Love, Pamela](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780063226562), by Pamela Anderson ++
   <details><summary>Being only three years younger...</summary>Being only three years younger than Anderson, I witnessed her take the world by storm: Playboy, Home Improvement, Baywatch (mostly through Joey and Chandler on Friends), Tommy Lee, PETA, and more. She's an icon from my early adulthood and hearing that she had written a memoir peaked my curiosity.<br><br>What I love about well written memoirs is not only hearing the person's story, but learning about their motivations and interests, the impact of their experiences, and thoughtful introspection years later. Those are the things that resonate with me as a reader. Anderson delivers them in a unique writing style that is approachable, candid, succinct, authentic, humble, and poetic.<br><br>Insecurity runs rampant through her story, even after she became a household name, and she takes the time to explain how it impacted her choices while also accepting responsibility for her decisions. She doesn't place the blame on others or use her insecurity as an excuse, rather as a means to help the reader understand her state of mind in many of those moments.<br><br>I learned a lot about Pamela, but here are some that stood out: she has a photographic memory; she's an avid reader of many genres, including philosophy, art, sociology, relationships, and spirituality; she's a philosopher with an introspective focus, looking inward for how to be a better person; when on location or traveling she always quietly visits local museums alone, without any fanfare; she regrets her breast augmentation; she didn't pursue fame, rather relationships and opportunities that stirred her passions; she's been a vegetarian/vegan since she was 6 or 7 years old; she writes poetry almost every day; she originally meant for this memoir to be written entirely in poetry (thankfully her editor convinced her to "add full sentences and paragraphs").<br><br>I went in with only my curiosity, no expectations, and it turned out to be much better than I anticipated. Regardless of the controversies surrounding her over the years, I respect the path she's travelled and thoroughly enjoyed reading her story.<br><br>"As crooked as the path was, I was learning and growing, thorns and all."<br><br></details>
1. [The Boys in the Boat](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780143125471), by Daniel James Brown
   <details><summary>Circumstances create opportunities...</summary>Circumstances create opportunities, which is what happened when the author discovered their elderly neighbor was a gold medal rower for the U.S.A. in the 1936 Olympics. I never anticipated being drawn into a book about eight young men rowing crew at the University of Washington (locally called U-Dub) in the early 1930's, and yet it pulled me in like quicksand. It's a fascinating tale about the unique comradery of a tight-knit team wrapped around the biography of a boy who suffered hardships, loss, and abandonment—all before the age of 15.<br><br>The pacing starts off a tad slow, but soon picked up to a comfortable cadence that kept me eager for the next page and chapter. Brown brings Joe's story to life, feeds your imagination all the details from his expansive research in ways that allow you to feel present in the moments from almost a century ago. As a Seattleite for over 25 years, it was fascinating to read references to local events, buildings, neighborhoods, and well-known people (like Royal Brougham). As a lifelong sports player and enthusiast, Brown aptly portrays the bonds of teammates brought through trials, conflicts, losses, and triumphs.<br><br>As a side note, it was interesting to see how the events in Joe's life correlated to the timeline of Hitler's rise to power and his manipulation of the world by hosting the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. I was glad to see this impactful thread of the story revealed early and carried throughout the whole book, culminating in the 1936 Olympic games.<br><br>Admittedly, I saw the 2023 movie before reading the book and I'm glad it happened in that order. Seeing the movie first allowed me to enjoy it without any judgmental comparison to the book. Reading the book after seeing the movie gave me time to reflect on the differences and appreciate the artistic choices for the translation to the big screen.<br><br></details>
1. [I'm Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781524760854), by Austin Channing Brown ++
   <details><summary>Powerful messages from a Black woman's lived experience...</summary>Powerful messages from a Black woman's lived experience (in the U.S.), here for you to digest and absorb at your own pace. Austin Channing Brown is a wonderful writer, deftly correlating her personal stories to larger systemic issues. She covers a wide variety of her encounters, occurrences, and trials that span school, religion, work, age, and more. While the topics and stories can be challenging for those of us who are white, such as her chapters on <em>white fragility</em> and <em>nice white people</em>, open your mind, focus on empathy, and embrace it as a learning opportunity. We can—and must—do better.<br><br>It was particularly interesting to hear how her childhood in a middle class, Christian, Black family in the Midwest surrounded by white communities (at school, church, and socially) shaped her perspectives. She had many of the stereotypical benefits, such as family and financial stability, well-funded schools, and access to university-level education. Yet she was immersed in white culture that emphasized her membership in the out-group (not white) and limited her exposure to many aspects of Black culture. She goes on to discuss how this affected her at later stages in life and the personal growth she experienced.<br><br>"Instead of offering empathy and action, whiteness finds new names for me and offers ominous advice. I am too sensitive, and should be careful with what I report. I am too angry, and should watch my tone when I talk about my experiences. I am too inflexible, and should learn to offer more grace to people who are really trying."<br><br>Before you ask your Black friend about their traumatic stories—yes, they most likely have them—settle in and absorb Austin Channing Brown's experiences.<br><br></details>
1. [The 1619 Project](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780593230572), created & edited by Nikole Hannah-Jones
1. _[The Untamed (Book 1): A Sinner's Prayer](https://www.strangercomics.com/collections/the-untamed/products/the-untamed-a-sinners-prayer-vol-1-hardcovers), by Sebastian A. Jones, Peter Bergting, & Darrell May_
   <details><summary>Bought this on a whim at Emerald City Comic Con...</summary>Bought this on a whim at Emerald City Comic Con (ECCC) after a pitch from Quincy at the <a href="https://www.strangercomics.com/">Stranger Comics</a> booth. The story sounded like an epic fantasy, with interesting characters that intertwine through multiple experiences in a vast world. I was also glad to see a Black woman as the protagonist, something you don't see often, if ever really, in the world of fantasy books and comics. Plus, I was supporting an author and artists who decided to do it themselves, maintaining control and ownership over their intellectual property. All that meant, sign me up!<br><br>The art is beautifully crafted, with a sense of etherealness, and the two main characters, Stranger and Niobe, obviously have interesting depths to plumb. Unfortunately, it didn't land with me quite as solidly as I'd hoped it would.<br><br>Regarding the art, the panels and colors chosen are exceptionally dark with little contrast, making it difficult to follow the non-verbal actions of the characters and, hence, the story itself. To be fair, my colorblindness might be contributing to this difficulty. For example, the red text on black pages was virtually invisible to me because I'm colorblind. I had to shine a bright light on it at an angle and hold it really close to read those passages. Thankfully they were short.<br><br>Stranger and Niobe have such possibilities and depths to be plumbed, but I felt like Jones barely scratched the surface in the first half of the book, which collects 7 issues. It was a slow start and by the time he added a few curious details of their past, they felt tacked on and I was already losing interest. Beyond that, I'll admit that Jones' prose is a tad more poetic, flowery, and sometimes longwinded than I enjoy in my comics.<br><br>I wanted to <em>really like</em> this series and it just wasn't for me. I'm sure—and I hope that—there are many out there who will love it.<br><br></details>
1. _[The Untamed (Book 2): Killing Floor](https://www.strangercomics.com/collections/the-untamed/products/the-untamed-killing-floor-vol-2-hardcovers), by Sebastion A. Jones, Peter Bergting, & Darrell May_
   <details><summary>The art is beautiful...</summary>The art is beautiful and the story progresses more quickly, with more action, than in The Untamed: A Sinner's Prayer (Book 1), but it still suffers from the things that I didn't like from the first book. Much of the art is too dark for me to easily discern what's going on with the non-verbal parts of the story. Jones provides more about Stranger and Niobe, but it was too little too late to grab my interest and hold it. Worth repeating, I wanted to <em>really like</em> this series and it just wasn't for me. I'm sure there are many out there who will love it.<br><br></details>
1. _[Essessa: The Fallen #1](https://www.strangercomics.com/collections/essessa), by Sebastion A. Jones, Joshua Cozine, Caanan White, & Darrell May_
   <details><summary>I think this is Essessa's origin story...</summary>I think this is Essessa's origin story, but am honestly not certain. If so, the story felt terse and rushed, without exploring any depths of the character. The art is fascinating, if somewhat busy and chaotic in moments, but it wasn't enough to make me want to see where the story goes from here. Worth repeating [again], I wanted to <em>really like</em> this series and it just wasn't for me. I'm sure there are many out there who will love it.<br><br></details>
1. [Helium](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781943735198), by Rudy Francisco
   <details><summary>Francisco's poetry is introspective...</summary>Francisco's poetry is introspective, personally revealing, painstakingly honest, and often humorous, while tackling challenging topics such as race, class, gender, relationships, and more. It's a quick read and I highly recommend it, even for those of us who don't lean towards reading poetry very often.<br><br></details>
1. [All the Sinners Bleed](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250831910), by S.A. Cosby ++
   <details><summary>A captivating read...</summary>A captivating read! I thoroughly enjoy Cosby's gritty, noir style of suspenseful thriller. It's a special boon that the book is set in the American South—where I lived for 11 years—and portrays Black Americans with such empathy, compassion, and authenticity. Cosby is a fantastic story teller. Cosby has solidified himself as one of my favorite crime, suspense authors!<br><br></details>
1. [My Darkest Prayer](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250867636), by S.A. Cosby
   <details><summary>An engrossing debut novel...</summary>An engrossing debut novel, that uses slightly more flowery language than his subsequent books, but is still an exhilarating read. After reading Razorblade Tears, Blacktop Wasteland, and All the Sinners Bleed, it's easy to tell that this was Cosby's first novel-length story and he was figuring out his writing style. Regardless of that, it's a suspenseful mystery in his Southern noir style and well worth reading.<br><br></details>
1. [Poyums](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781805301387), by Len Pennie
1. [Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780143036531), by Neil Postman
1. [Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250866455), by Matthew Perry ([abandoned](#abandoned))
   <details><summary>This memoir wasn't for me...</summary>This memoir wasn't for me. The writing was frenetic, as though it was literally written by Chandler Bing, his Friends character who was infamous for his zinger one-liners. Perry spends a lot of time delving into the meaning behind his life decisions and patterns. And it makes sense that they revolve around his problems with addiction, but the stories didn't resonate with me. I stopped reading at 20%.<br><br></details>
1. [The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780385534260), by David Grann
   <details><summary>A fascinating true story...</summary>A fascinating true story about 18th century sailors being shipwrecked and the intrigue that follows, all the way until their eventual return to England years later. Supported by the sheer volume of notes in the back of the book, Grann did extensive research and presented it chronologically, as the stories of the sailors unfolded. While it was interesting and held my attention, I found that it moved along a little slowly for me. I'm not exactly sure why that was the case, but it took me longer to read than I expected for a 257 page book.<br><br></details>

1. [Tranquility by Tuesday: 9 Ways to Calm the Chaos and Make Time for What Matters](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780593419007), by Laura Vanderkam ++
   <details><summary>Realistic and practical...</summary>Realistic and practical advice from Laura Vanderkam, as I expected. I've read other books of hers and they all provide exactly that in a succinct and entertaining writing style. I'm grateful for how she breaks down the topic of managing your time—and accompanying sense of being overwhelmed—into bite-sized chunks that make sense and are easy to work on individually. These individual chunks can add up to significant change, if you take the time to implement them.<br><br></details>
1. _[Giant Days (Vol. 1)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781608867899), by John Allison, Whitney Cogar, & Lissa Treiman_ ++
   <details><summary>A thoroughly fun...</summary>A thoroughly fun, quirky, and enjoyable story of 3 young women's friendships and adventures during their college (university) years. It had me nostalgic for my college days, not only the adventures similar to theirs, but the ones that were different and unique from mine. For those yet to attend university, here's a taste of what it can be like and a reminder to be courageous, find those friendships and experiences that will be the building blocks of adulthood!<br><br>Note for the 'Extra Credit' and 'Early Registration' volumes: They're still good, but not quite as much so as the original volumes 1-14. You can read them anytime, but I recommend finishing at least volume 1 of the primary/main track first.<br><br></details>

1. [The Simple Path to Wealth](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781533667922), by JL Collins
   <details><summary>I appreciate the simplicity...</summary>I appreciate the simplicity of the author's concept along with the real-world evidence that supports it. I've been investing this way for years because of the simplicity and low cost, it's nice to see all of the research that confirms my decision. This book makes the topic of investing and saving accessible to everyone. In fact, the book could be summarized in a page or two, if that's all you really want or need, but the author takes the time to explain the history and reasoning behind their approach in ways that make sense to everyone, even those who don't have a financial or investing background (like the author's daughter, who it was initially written for).<br><br></details>
1. [Laws of Depravity (Martyr Maker #1)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781728261003), by Eriq La Salle
   <details><summary>Wrapping up theology and morality...</summary>Wrapping up theology and morality in the chase to catch a serial killer, La Salle does a tremendous job with the tale and the characters. The book is only a mystery for the first half, then the killer is revealed and it becomes more about the chase, although he still manages to throw in several surprises up until the very end. I particularly appreciate the depth he provides for each of the characters, giving the reader interesting and pertinent backstories. Thoroughly enjoyed and looking forward to the next in the series.<br><br></details>
1. [The Underground Railroad](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780345804327), by Colson Whitehead
   <details><summary>It feels odd...</summary>It feels odd to say that I enjoyed this book when it deals with such a horrific topic. Yet, Whitehead does a wonderful job telling the tale, weaving together the various characters, and reimagining the metaphorical underground railroad into a real tunnel-based system running through the country. He portrays slavery in all of its horrors and obviously did extensive research on its many facets. That's why I can't really say I enjoyed the book, but it definitely kept me engaged and wanting to know how Cora handled each (mostly tragic) situation.<br><br></details>
1. [They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780300251838), by Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers ([abandoned](#abandoned))
   <details><summary>Interesting historical information...</summary>Interesting historical information about the slave-owning white women of the antebellum South, most of which I was unfamiliar with. It's vastly apparent that the author did extensive research, providing citations for nearly every accounting. I truly appreciate that she centered the enslaved peoples' accounts, versus the whitewashed records most of us grew up with, if we learned about it at all. Having said that, I found the writing repetitive; it lacked an evolving narrative that guided the reader and was dry, like studying a text book. I finished 25% of the book before deciding to stop reading.<br><br></details>
1. [Finding Me: A Memoir](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780063037366), by Viola Davis ++
   <details><summary>I had no idea...</summary>I had no idea about Viola Davis' childhood: extreme poverty, physically abusive father, emotionally unavailable mother, surrounded by blatant racism, and full of courage (even when she didn't realize it in the moments). This was a fascinating journey with Viola as she examines her evolution into who she is today. I've always enjoyed her as an actor and now I have the utmost of respect and appreciation for her as a person.<br><br></details>
1. [Black Cop's Kid](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C66SKLH), by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ++
   <details><summary>I'm consistently impressed...</summary>I'm consistently impressed with Abdul-Jabbar's knowledge, empathy, sincerity, and candor in his writing and this long-form essay has all of those things. He explains how his relationship with his father, a NYC cop, impacted and inspired his life-long pursuit of social justice, even though they didn't speak about it. Abdul-Jabbar discusses the paradox of being a Black police officer, wanting to help others while participating in a broken system. Highly recommend subscribing to his <a href="https://kareem.substack.com/">newsletter</a>.<br><br></details>
1. [Legendborn (Book 1): Legendborn](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534441613), by Tracy Deonn ++
   <details><summary>A fantastic Arthurian-inspired tale...</summary>A fantastic Arthurian-inspired tale of a Black teenage girl from North Carolina who finds herself entrenched in a prophecy that she didn't know about and definitely didn't want to be a part of. Deonn builds a uniquely interesting world around the Legends of King Arthur, full of complexity and intrigue with characters that grow and adapt with the story. I sincerely appreciate how Deonn presents Bree, the main character, and the many experiences that are unique precisely because she's a young Black woman who often has to deal with microaggressions and racism.<br><br></details>
1. [Legendborn (Book 2): Bloodmarked](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534441637), by Tracy Deonn ++
   <details><summary>This second book...</summary>This second book in the Legendborn series continues the tale of a Black teenage girl from North Carolina, Bree, who finds herself entrenched in an Arthurian-inspired prophecy. Deonn continues to build on and explain the complexities of the magical world around Bree. There were several unexpected plot twists and the characters continue to evolve in interesting ways. Once again, I appreciate Deonn's tie-ins to the history of enslaved people in the U.S. and how it continues to impact our culture. She integrates that history into the storyline with depth, care, and respect.<br><br></details>

   <details><summary>Wheelan brings brevity and clarity...</summary>Wheelan brings brevity and clarity to a tedious subject matter, statistical analysis. This is nothing like the textbook for my statistics class in college, which might be why I actually read this one cover-to-cover. Wheelan adeptly translates advanced concepts into real-world situations using clear language and intuitive examples.  I found the silly sense of humor enjoyable, but I can see where it might bother some folks. All in all, I found it informative and often enjoyable to read, which given the subject matter is a formidable accomplishment, one to be lauded!<br><br>"Statistics is like a high-caliber weapon: helpful when used correctly and potentially disastrous in the wrong hands."<br><br></details>

   <details><summary>This was on my to-read list...</summary>This was on my to-read list for a few years before I actually cracked it open. After enjoying the live-action series, with Henry Cavill as Geralt, I decided it was time to visit the original material and...it wasn't for me. I found the writing to be terse and unengaging, so I stopped reading after ~50 pages.<br><br></details>
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 0.5): The Assassin's Blade - Prequel Novellas](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639731091), by Sarah J. Maas
   <details><summary>This collection of prequel novellas...</summary>This collection of prequel novellas were written and released individually before Throne of Glass (book 1), then later published together in this collection. I'm glad that I started the series here, with Caleana's origin stories, because they gave me a thorough understanding of and appreciation for her character's backstory when I began Throne of Glass. The novellas are fun, engaging, and entertaining!<br><br></details>
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 1): Throne of Glass](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639730957), by Sarah J. Maas
   <details><summary>After sitting on my to-be-read shelf...</summary>After sitting on my to-be-read shelf for the last 5-6 years, my 19-year-old daughter decided to read this book and soon got hooked, requesting all seven other books in the series from the library. We both enjoy young-adult fantasy worlds and she enjoyed the first few books so much it encouraged me to bump it to the top of my reading list (books are also a wonderful way for us to connect). In Caleana Sardothien, Maas has created an anti-hero with courage and compassion, a mixture of bravado and foolhardiness, and the skill and persistence to prevail. The author sets the stage for a much broader tale and expansive world while beginning to delve into Caleana's character growth. You can tell that this is the first book in a longer series, yet it tells a solid tale on its own.<br><br></details>
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 2): Crown of Midnight](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639730971), by Sarah J. Maas
   <details><summary>The tale continues to evolve...</summary>The tale continues to evolve as Maas delves further into the characters development, throwing more than a few twists and turns in their paths and plot twists (some that surprised me). Caleana is a likeable character, even through those moments where you know she's making the wrong decision or acting brashly, and I always found myself rooting for her. Like many YA fantasy novels, there are moments (yes, tropes) where you have to suspend disbelief and just go with the story, but they don't detract from the book. An enjoyable and engrossing read!<br><br></details>
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 3): Heir of Fire](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639730995), by Sarah J. Maas
   <details><summary>Not halfway through the series yet...</summary>Not halfway through the series yet (this is book 3 of 7) and Maas was able to surprise me again with several plot twists. Well done! The author took a slightly different approach this time, presenting lengthier chapters from different characters' perspectives, and I enjoyed it. Several new characters were introduced and some historical events are coming to their fruition, creating an even wider web of events going on in the world of Erilea and foreshadowing more events to come. I enjoy the world Maas is building and the stories she's pulling together.<br><br></details>
1. _[Harley Quinn #28](https://a.co/d/bcEfZRr), by Tini Howard, Sweeney Boo, & Erica Henderson_
   <details><summary>A fun, lighthearted, and conflict-filled romp...</summary>A fun, lighthearted, and conflict-filled romp around Gotham with Harley Quinn, where she experiences some consequences for her fight-first-think-later decisions. Admittedly, I primarily read this because I've been a big fan of the artist, <a href="https://www.sweeneyboo.com/">Sweeney Boo</a>, for several years now. When she announced that she was drawing the latest storyline, I put in an order at my local comic shop.<br><br></details>
1. _[The Librarian of Auschwitz: The Graphic Novel](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250842985), by Salva Rubio, Antonio Iturbe, Lilit Žekulin Thwaites, & Loreto Aroca_
   <details><summary>This is a tale that must still be told...</summary>This is a tale that must still be told because some are too eager to forget the horrors of an authoritarian regime. I enjoyed this representation of Dita's story. While it's horrifyingly sad, it's also inspiring to see Dita's persistence and determination throughout her imprisonment. The art in the graphic novel is well done and represents the situations accurately, without overemphasizing or downplaying the violence and horror present. For a sobering story, this is a wonderful interpretation.<br><br></details>
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 4): Queen of Shadows](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639731015), by Sarah J. Maas
   <details><summary>More interesting character developments and surprise plot twists...</summary>More interesting character developments and surprise plot twists, while moving the story forward significantly. Again, well done! Now that I've passed the halfway point on this series, I want to reiterate that the series (still) contains some YA fantasy tropes. They're not worth dissecting in detail, rather consider this a warning that there are moments where you'll be better off suspending disbelief or even rolling your eyes a bit and just keep reading.<br><br></details>
1. [Throne of Glass (Book 6): Tower of Dawn](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639731053), by Sarah J. Maas
   <details><summary>Diverging from the main characters...</summary>Diverging from the main characters, this book still delivered an engaging adventure and contributed major plot points (with a few more twists) to the overall story arc. Very enjoyable! Some criticism: Maas tends to dwell on the minutiae of her characters love interests and be unnecessarily wordy in most scenarios, which leads me to believe that with a different editor, this could have been a 400-500 page book instead of 668 (which is a lengthy novel). Same goes for the 3rd and 4th books in the series, they're longer than they really need to be. Having said that, I still enjoyed them and they're still fairly quick reads, regardless of breaking 600 pages. <em>Note: The events in this book (#6) run concurrently with those in Empire of Storms (#5), but I read this one first based on a recommendation that it was a more seamless story arc to move from Empire of Storms (#5) directly into Kingdom of Ash (#7).</em><br><br></details>

1. [Throne of Glass (Book 5): Empire of Storms](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639731039), by Sarah J. Maas
   <details><summary>This is a romance novel disguised as a fantasy...</summary>This is a romance novel disguised as a fantasy adventure. It's like an annoying magical version of Temptation Island, with everyone pairing up and sharing their endlessly pedantic thoughts of romance, sex, and love for each other. Why does every single character need to become enthralled and fall hopelessly in love with a counterpart? This is the sort of YA trope that I can handle in small bits, but anything more and it ruins the story for me. I honestly wanted to stop reading before I reached halfway through, but I'm too invested in the series at this point. Since I read Tower of Dawn before this one, I only have one more book after this to finish the whole series. Thankfully, Maas toned down the romance around the time I was at page 500 (75% through, mind you!) and started focusing more on the plot.<br><br></details>
1. [Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250758040), by Melanie Mitchell
   <details><summary>Insightful observations about the history...</summary>Insightful observations about the history and evolution of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry over the last several decades. Mitchell does a fine job turning what can be pretty dry material into relatable and understandable stories that explain how we got to the current state of affairs (in 2019, when the book was published).<br><br>My big takeaway is that since the 1940's, the experts grandiose predictions are quite hand-wavy, ambiguous, and rarely come true. For example, in 1965, Nobel laureate Herbert Simon predicted, "Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work that a man can do." This is referred to as generative artificial intelligence and considered how to simulate human consciousness and deciphering context with computers. In 2023, this is still not possible, not even close.<br><br>What has come true is that AI, specifically machine learning, has been used to solve very specific challenges, such as identifying and reproducing language in large language models (LLM). This is extraordinary, but it's also done within defined boundaries, which is the rub. In order to develop generative AI, those boundaries need to disappear or be expanded exponentially. Mitchell provides many interesting examples of this conundrum, helping to put a realistic lens on what we can expect from artificial intelligence. She doesn't provide predictions of her own, only [realistic] opinions on the predictions others have made.<br><br></details>

   <details><summary>Fascinating way to present a memoir...</summary>This is a fascinating way to present a memoir, the main character's story alongside the author's journey creating it. The author intermingles her own life experiences with those of wanting to understand this pivotal moment in her father's life, deciding to write the book, and her investigation to learn the truth. I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of this book!<br><br>I greatly appreciate Leta's vulnerability in divulging how racism has impacted her throughout her life, from childhood to the overtly racist behaviors of Trump and the [sometimes] more subtle racism found in his supporters.<br><br>"It would be several years before I could put words to what I found so disturbing: that most of the people around me either didn’t care that we now had a president advocating racial hatred and violence, or they enjoyed it. It was as if I had a dangerous enemy who’d made known his feelings about me and my family, and the people around me were either indifferent or quietly supporting the enemy."<br><br></details>

   <details><summary>Being only five years younger...</summary>Being only five years younger than Paulina, I remember her meteoric rise to modeling fame in the 1980s, handful of acting parts, marriage to Ric Ocasek, and seeming disappearance from public life. Admittedly, it was her recent extreme vulnerability on Instagram about aging and society's expectations of women that drove my interest in her memoir.<br><br>She's a wonderful writer, knowing how to engage and entertain the reader as she tells her story. But what really caught my attention and kept me turning pages was her sincerity and vulnerability, her willingness to bare her thoughts and feelings—both good and bad—about her experiences. This isn't a simple recounting of the successes in her life, it's a thoughtful analysis where she describes her anxieties, insecurities, mistakes, surprises, and much more. Well worth reading.<br><br>"You know how you don't get wrinkles? You die young."<br><br></details>

After a 4-year hiatus (2018-2022) and a heartbreaking cliffhanger in volume 9, thus begins the second half of Saga's planned 108 issue (18 volume) story. I still adore <a href="https://fionastaples.com/">Fiona Staples</a> artwork for its stunning line work, beautiful coloring, and her ability to translate all sorts of environments. Vaughan's storytelling is the other highlight of this series, although this volume felt a little slower than previous plot arcs, I appreciate slowly settling back into the characters, their quirks, and the choices they make. I didn't reread volumes 1-9 before reading this one, but am going to reread 1-10 before 11; there was so much I had forgotten in the 4 years since I'd read them.<br><br></details>

   <details><summary>The second in the series...</summary>The second in the series, La Salle continues plumbing the depths of the characters in his gritty police procedural. He does an excellent job of building suspense and maintaining the mystery, while revealing tidbits along the way to keep you interested. The story delves into transphobia and I—a cisgender male—felt that it was handled respectfully and with care towards that community.<br><br></details>

Broken into 3 chapters, the presentation is exceptional. The first chapter presents a succinct bill of rights for learning slowly. In the second chapter, they combine one person's artistic representation with another person's written explanation of why slow learning is important to them. It's a compelling and thought-provoking way to discuss the topic—I relished the artists renditions. The third and final chapter provides tools we can all use to become better students and teachers through slower learning.<br><br></details>

Rubin provides succinct, practical tips on getting organized that improve the calmness of our emotional state. I found many useful suggestions, yet several of them were already in my repertoire—of course, I did enjoy the confirmation. It's worth a read if you enjoy being organized or feel that you need some guidance in getting organized. Other books I've read on the topic tend to add a lot of fluff to increase their page count and I appreciate that Rubin doesn't do that.<br><br></details>

   <details><summary>Even though I'm a long time fan...</summary>Even though I'm a long time fan of Godin's newsletter and books, this one didn't quite grab me like others have. Don't get me wrong, like most of his writing, this book is packed full with good information that's presented in an easily digestible manner. Since I read his newsletter regularly, I think this book felt like a rehash of those topics instead of new ideas or even existing ideas presented differently. Still worth the read, though!<br><br></details>

Brian Hurtt's art is fun and complex, visually pleasing as it conveys the characters and their trials. Cullen Bunn's writing exposes more of the history behind the guns, their legend, and the supporting cast in an entertaining manner and with a few surprises. I particularly like Becky's strength and independence, and how that plays out with the macho men surrounding her. It's a page turner!<br><br></details>

The author creates worlds with complexities and challenges that mirror our own, yet also fills them with common practices and ethos that break many stereotypes of our reality. She throws you into the deep end first by starting the story off where she does and I don't disagree with some reviewers who said they would have appreciated a bit of backstory or history to prepare them for the ride. Having said that, she does a fantastic job of laying out the story over time, exposing us to the characters and moments of their growth—historical and present time. I'm excited to see where Wells takes this story and how Kai, Ziede, Tahren, and the others evolve!<br><br>Martha Wells solidified herself as one of my all-time favorite authors when I devoured the Murderbot series in 2020 and followed it up with the Books of Raksura in 2021. Whether it's sci-fi or fantasy, Wells creates extensive and detailed worlds that build off of our own emotional journeys while adding unique and interesting twists. Worth calling out, I truly appreciate the equity that Wells builds into her fictional worlds, whether it's queer relationships or gender presentation, she presents openness and acceptance as the norm.<br><br>A well-written review: <a href="https://www.tor.com/2023/05/31/book-review-witch-king-by-martha-wells/">A Lavish, Crunchy Fantasy: Witch King by Martha Wells</a><br><br></details>

It's everything any devout fan could hope for when asking the famous lead singer "how'd you do it and what's it been like?" His writing is eloquent, articulate, expressive, and, yes, poetic. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the paths he's taken, the relationships he's experienced, and his drive to make the world a better place through philanthropy and political activism.<br><br>Whether or not he calls himself one, Paul David Hewson—Bono's legal name—is a philosopher. Throughout the book he sprinkles his ruminations and conversations with others on religion, personal faith, scriptures, and all sorts of philosophical questions. I appreciate and respect that he openly and routinely questions his own religious faith as well as the scriptures it's based on. He looks beyond the dogma to understand the philosophy. I admire that this perspective is evident in his song lyrics and performances.<br><br>"To move people with music, you first have to be moved by it."<br><br></details>
1. [My Own Kind of Freedom: A Firefly Novel](https://dreamcafe.com/my-own-kind-of-freedom/), by Steven Brust
   <details><summary>Another fun escapade...</summary>Another fun escapade with the Firefly crew! Brust captures the authentic feel and sentiment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)">Firefly</a> and its motley crew of characters. There were moments where the dialog moved back and forth quickly, like in the show, but this was more difficult to digest in a written version. Fortunately, most of it made sense because I've watched the series—more than once. As fan fiction goes, this is top notch and I recommend it with that caveat.<br><br></details>

1. [Throne of Glass (Book 7): Kingdom of Ash](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781639731077), by Sarah J. Maas
   <details><summary>Back to adventuring...</summary>Back to adventuring, this final book in the Throne of Glass series delivers all the goods. Maas wraps up everything with a big bow while throwing in more than a few plot twists along the way, creating a satisfying—if somewhat predictable—ending to Aelin's (Caleana's) tale. My only criticism is that it's ridiculously long at 988 pages; the author's exceptionally descriptive writing style could have been split into two books.<br><br>Having finished the series, I would describe it as a light young adult (YA) fantasy adventure that is easy and fun to read. The biggest irritation for me was the excessively descriptive focus on romance at times and that every major character has a 'true love.' Seriously, why not let some of them be confidently and independently single, without pining away for their 'soul mate.' There are several moments when the series is a romance thinly disguised as a fantasy adventure. But if you don't take it too seriously and enjoy the story for what it is, it's a fun read.<br><br></details>

1. [Teaching to Transgress](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780415908085), by bell hooks
   <details><summary>An insightful look into...</summary>An insightful look into bell hooks' experience in and thoughts on academia. Gloria Jean Watkins discusses her various philosophies about the current state of education during her time and how it could be improved.<br><br>It was particularly interesting to hear how desegregation in the 1960s impacted education for Black students. It removed them from the classrooms of Black teachers, who had lived similar cultural experiences, and worked to empower, as well as educate, their young minds. With segregation, Black students were placed with white teachers who could not relate to their lived experiences and didn't have the desire to improve them. She expands on how this impacted her personal love for education, that "always and only responding and reacting to white folks" removed the freedom to learn for Black students. She continues to describe her educational journey and how it shaped her ideology for teaching, that it should consist of pedagogical strategies to encourage freedom in thought and discussion between teachers and students.<br><br>I especially liked the concept of engaged pedagogy. Students want to learn about the topics in ways that are meaningful to their lives and viewpoints, not to merely regurgitate information. When teachers step away from an authoritative perspective—that they own the knowledge to be given—and become vulnerable in sharing their own experiences as teachers who are also still learning. This mutually engaging relationship allows both parties the freedom to learn from each other.<br><br>There's a lot more to this book than I can cover in a short summary. Read it to understand hooks' experiences, motivation, and goals.<br><br></details>
1. [Starter Villain](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780765389220), by John Scalzi ++
   <details><summary>One of my best whimsical purchases...</summary>One of my best whimsical purchases in quite some time—at <a href="https://www.bookpeople.com/">BookPeople</a> in Austin, Texas. The book is ridiculously entertaining and lighthearted! A fast-paced story where the protagonist is a fish out of water, suddenly entangled with a small group of elitist thick-headed billionaire tech bros who truly believe they're super villains. There are also adorable cats. What more could you want in a hilarious allegory for income inequality?<br><br></details>

   <details><summary>A police procedural with heart...</summary>A police procedural with heart, this reminds me how much I enjoyed the early seasons of Blue Bloods. Ninth in the series, this novella is an enjoyable return to characters I've come to know with a few plot twists thrown in for good measure. It's lightweight and fun reading.<br><br></details>

1. [Dancing in the Mosque: An Afghan Mother's Letter to Her Son](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780062970329), by Homeira Qaderi ++
   <details><summary>Enlightening, emotional, overwhelming...</summary>Enlightening, emotional, overwhelming, sorrowful, and hopeful are words I'd use to describe this wonderful memoir by Homeira Qaderi. The hardships she's endured throughout her life are worthy of the story and she entwines the words with emotion and soul that elevates it beyond any of my expectations. The experiences she shares are based around letters to her son while they're forcefully separated—she's in the United States and he's in Afghanistan.<br><br>No doubt, Qaderi is an artful storyteller and skilled writer. When you know that everything is her truth, her life, her experiences, the emphasis of each tale is magnified tenfold, a hundredfold, and more. It astounds me—and reminds me of my extreme privilege—that she not only lived through so many horrendous experiences, but had—and still has—the courage to fight for her beliefs and rights in such circumstances. I have the utmost admiration for her and am thankful that she shared her story, helping the rest of us in the world understand the experiences of women in Afghanistan.<br><br>"The story of Afghan women is tightly woven with the history and politics of our nation. The story is one of endless misery woven through times of peace and war and it flows with pain, but never reaches the healing ocean."<br><br></details>
1. [Runestone Saga (Book 1): Children of Ragnarok](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780063018686), by Cinda Williams China
   <details><summary>Engaging characters, interesting story arcs...</summary>Engaging characters, interesting story arcs, and a few plot twists make this young adult (YA) Viking-inspired fantasy adventure a pleasure to read. This first book in the Runestone Saga avoids many of the YA fantasy tropes while maintaining its approachability, which I truly appreciate. Chima obviously did her research, presenting the Norse and Viking mythologies with enough details to make things interesting while not overwhelming the reader.<br><br></details>
1. _[Norse Mythology (Vol. 1)](https://a.co/d/a13gQyM), by Neil Gaiman, P. Craig Russell, Jerry Ordway (Illustrator), Mike Mignola (Illustrator), Jill Thompson (Illustrator, Colorist), David Rubín (Illustrator, Colorist), Piotr Kowalksi (Illustrator), Dave Stewart (Colorist), Lovern Kindzierski (Colorist), Galen Showman (Letterist)_

Knowing only a little about the subject, I enjoyed the artists interpretation as I learned about the different origin stories.<br><br></details>
1. [The She Series Book](https://www.karenhallion.com/thesheseriesbook), by Karen Hallion ++
   <details><summary>A delightful way to introduce readers to fascinating women...</summary>A delightful way to introduce readers to fascinating women, from both present day and the past. <a href="https://www.karenhallion.com/thesheseriesbook">The book</a> was inspired by Karen Hallion's <a href="https://www.karenhallion.com/she-he-series">She Series</a> of fictional and real characters, which began around late 2017. Each portrait depicts the woman and a single word that describes their actions…what they do or did to create an impact on the world. I love that the book was a collaborative effort between Karen and several authors, combining Karen's artwork with a writer's description of the woman's life, experiences, and influence.<br><br>For the women that I recognized, I still learned something new about them. There were several women I hadn't heard of before reading the book and I'm thankful to have learned about them.<br><br>Here are some of my favorites of the women I knew of before She Series: Advance [Nichelle Nichols], Become [Michelle Obama], Delight [Betty White], Dissent [Ruth Bader Ginsberg], Engage [Stacey Abrams], Provoke [Joan Rivers], Stand [Malala Yousafzai], Write [Emily Dickinson].<br><br>Here are some of my favorites of the women I learned of through She Series: Activate [Betty Friedan], Be [Isra Hirsi], Climb [Junko Tabei], Defend [Autumn Peltier], Endeavor [Mae Jemison], Evolve [Grace Lee Boggs], Galvanize [Helen Zia], Impact [Rebecca Lee Crumpler], Outwit [Gail Simone], Question [Marjane Satrapi].<br><br>"By highlighting women's actions, a book can inspire and empower other women to pursue their goals and achieve success, while also challenging societal norms and expectations. It can also educate readers about the many ways in which women have shaped history and influenced social, political, and cultural change." ~<a href="https://www.karenhallion.com/thesheseriesbook">Karen Hallion</a><br><br></details>
1. [Murderbot Diaries (Book 7): System Collapse](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250826978), by Martha Wells ++
   <details><summary>My favorite Murderbot is back...</summary>My favorite Murderbot is back (see <a href="/reads/top-reads-2020/">Top reads for 2020</a>). They're still sarcastic, self-aware, and learning the discomforts of their autonomy, along with the perks. Wells is an ingenious writer, creating character arcs and plotlines that captivate me like few other authors. Seventh in the Murderbot Diaries, System Collapse continues the tale immediately after the events of the sixth book, Network Effect—recommend rereading Network Effect first. A personal side note: I had the joy of seeing Martha Wells speak at a local book store and sign my hard cover copy of System Collapse. :) <br><br></details>
1. _Vixx the Hunter #1, by Jeff Massey, Pat Shand, Larry Watts, James Offredi, Damien Torres, Jim Campbell, & Shannon Lee_
   <details><summary>A slightly different take on a dystopian...</summary>A slightly different take on a dystopian world and those still alive dealing with the fallout. It's an interesting story with well-drawn imagery.<br><br></details>
1. [The Future](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781668025680), by Naomi Alderman ++
   <details><summary>Once again, Alderman captured...</summary>Once again, Alderman captured my interest and held it closely through each plot twist and turn. The Future was a gripping, intriguing, and fun read. I especially enjoyed the companies that were thinly veiled stand-ins for Facebook, Apple, and Amazon and the characters that panned their billionaire CEOs. Their plans are ludicrous, yet seem plausible when you consider one of those real-life billionaires actually built a penis-shaped space ship. The Power was one of my <a href="/reads/top-reads-2020/">top reads for 2020</a> and The Future is likely to be in the 2023 list.<br><br>I was fortunate enough to see Naomi Alderman speak at a local bookstore for the release of this book and she was wonderful: engaging, interesting, and funny.<br><br></details>
1. [City of Bones](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250861672), by Martha Wells ++
   <details><summary>A skillfully crafted story...</summary>A skillfully crafted story set in a richly constructed society set thousands of years after apocalyptic events drastically change the planet—that is presumably Earth. As I've come to expect, Wells develops characters with intricacy and depth, allowing us to witness their subtle evolution as the story unfolds. The plot flows well and the characters are engaging. It's truly a pleasure to read.<br><br>A personal side note: I had the joy of seeing Martha Wells speak at a local book store and sign my copy of the newly revised edition of City of Bones.<br><br></details>
1. _[Saga (Vol. 1: chs.1-6)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781607066019), by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples_ (reread) ++
   <details><summary>I first read Saga in 2017...</summary>I first read Saga in 2017 (volumes 1-4), then reread it in 2019 (volumes 1-9) and it continues to be one of my favorite graphic novels. After a 4-year hiatus (2018-2022) and a heartbreaking cliffhanger in volume 9, Vaughan and Staples have begun the second half of Saga's planned 108 issue (18 volume) story...and I'm here for the ride!<br><br>Rereading Volume 1 was a lovely reminder of how it all began. Vaughan is a storyteller extraordinaire, able to convey depths of character, emotion, and plot with just the right amount of narrative. He introduces us to a couple who are deeply in love, battling the rest of the world to simply stay alive. As the story unfolds, we experience new and unexpected elements in world-building, yet they're tied together with commonalities that help readers to feel engaged. Staples' artwork is stunning. She's able to create fantastical environments and characters that expand upon and improve the story, making it such a wonderful reading experience.<br><br></details>
1. _[Saga (Vol. 2: chs.7-12)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781607066927), by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples_ (reread) ++
   <details><summary>The plot thickens as we meet new characters...</summary>The plot thickens as we meet new characters, each a part of the unfolding story in ways we couldn't expect. In-laws, exes, and authors. Vaughan continues to build an imaginative world that is drawn amazingly by Staples. This is my third reread since first picking it up in 2017 and it's still one of my favorites.<br><br></details>
1. _[Saga (Vol. 3: chs.13-18)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781607069317), by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples_ (reread) ++
   <details><summary>The in-law, ex, and author...</summary>The in-law, ex, and author–along with others we've met–continue their parts in the story, giving us a few more unexpected twists. Vaughan's storytelling and Staples' art keep the story interesting and entertaining.<br><br></details>
1. _[Saga (Vol. 4: chs.19-24)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781632150776), by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples_ (reread) ++
   <details><summary>Things continue to go off the rails...</summary>Things continue to go off the rails, in so many ways and with just about every character, including a few new ones. There's rarely a moment of peace or tranquility, although Hazel—as the narrator—expressly states that the odd family did experience them in many moments in between. Vaughan and Staples continue to deliver an epic story.<br><br></details>
1. _[Saga (Vol. 5: chs.25-30)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781632154385), by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples_ (reread) ++
   <details><summary>Instability, unpredictability, and a bit of deranged vengeance...</summary>Instability, unpredictability, and a bit of deranged vengeance ensue with this volume of the story…and it all centers around parenthood. Imagine that. :)<br><br></details>
1. _[Saga (Vol. 6: chs.31-36)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781632157119), by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples_ (reread) ++
   <details><summary>More twists and turns than a snake playing...</summary>More twists and turns than a snake playing tic-tac-toe. As always, Staples' art is phenomenal and Vaughan's story continues to evolve in unexpected and entertaining ways.<br><br></details>
1. _[Saga (Vol. 7: chs.37-42)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534300606), by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples_ (reread) ++
   <details><summary>The story and art continue to fascinate and entertain...</summary>The story and art continue to fascinate and entertain, engaging as ever, leading the reader down unknown paths. This one involved some goodbyes–one sad, one not–and a few big twists. Such a wild ride.<br><br></details>
1. _[Saga (Vol. 8: chs.43-48)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534303492), by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples_ (reread) ++
   <details><summary>Consistently compelling stories and immersive...</summary>Consistently compelling stories and immersive artwork. The consistency is the secret to this epic story's success. Obviously, Vaughan has a grand imagination and Staples is an extremely skilled artist, but the fact that they consistently deliver such high quality is a testament to them. This is my second time reading through the series and it holds up. Thoroughly enjoying it.<br><br></details>
1. _[Saga (Vol. 9: chs.49-54)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534308374), by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples_ (reread) ++
   <details><summary>A cliffhanger ending...</summary>A cliffhanger ending to the first half of Saga's planned 18 volume (108 issue) epic tale. After publishing Volume 9 (ending with ch. 54) in 2018, Vaughan and Staples took a 4-year hiatus. Now that they've resumed the second half of the tale (beginning with ch. 55 in 2022), I'm rereading to refresh my memory. It doesn't disappoint, even/especially the second time. Damn…just…damn.<br><br></details>
1. _[Saga (Vol. 10: chs.55-60)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534323346), by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples_ (reread) ++
   <details><summary>This time around I went...</summary>This time around I went back and reread volumes 1-9 beforehand and the continuity made a big difference, improving the reading experience. There are unexpected plot twists—to be expected from Vaughan—and Staples' art always conveys so much more than I expect imagery to. Overall, yet another volume that's a joy to experience. I recommend rereading at least volume 9 before starting 10, but starting from volume 1 is even better.<br><br></details>
1. _[Saga (Vol. 11: chs.61-66)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534399136), by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples_ ++
   <details><summary>What more can I say...</summary>What more can I say about this series that I haven't already said in my thoughts on previous volumes? It's entertaining, thought-provoking, intriguing, exciting, boundary-pushing, beautiful, sad, hopeful, and so much more. Read it from the beginning.<br><br></details>

# Abandoned

Books I didn't finish are marked as [abandoned](#abandoned).

Why didn't I finish the book? I like to read one book at a time and years ago it took me
months to slug my way through [a book](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1938583995?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1)
that everyone kept telling me "keep reading, it gets better, you'll love it." Nope, didn't
love it...or even like it. Lesson learned. If I don't enjoy a book within the first 30-50
pages, I stop reading it. There are way too many amazing [authors and books out there](https://sketchplanations.com/3500-lifetime-reads)
in the world for me to enjoy, not to mention my lengthy to-read list
([tsundoku](https://sketchplanations.com/tsundoku)).

<p align="center">
<a href="https://sketchplanations.com/tsundoku"><img src="/images/tsundoku-sketchplanations.jpg" alt="Jono Hey of Sketchplanations describes tsundoku - the act of acquiring books and letting them pile up without reading them. In the drawn picture, a smiling person lies in a bedroom on a bed surrounded by books stacked on the bed, the floor, and two shelves affixed to the wall."></a>
