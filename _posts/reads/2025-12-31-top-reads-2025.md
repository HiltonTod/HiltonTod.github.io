**Redshirts**, by [John Scalzi](https://whatever.scalzi.com/), is a clever and fun ode to those poor saps
on the original [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series) who wore red
uniforms and _never_ seemed to survive the away missions.

DRAFT 

Similar to one of my [top reads](https://todhilton.com/reads/top-reads-2024) from last year
([Exit Interview](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780374600907), by Kristi Coulter), this memoir is an expose of a
technology company that has grown to have an unbelievable amount of influence and control on the world, Meta (known
more prominently as Facebook).

[![Hiroshima, by John Hersey](/images/cover_Hiroshima_JohnHersey_150.jpg "Hiroshima, by John Hersey"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780679721031)

Before our trip to the city of Hiroshima in Japan, I wanted to learn more about the atomic bomb that was
dropped by the United States military during World War II, on August 6, 1945. There are numerous books about the
Manhattan Project, Enola Gay, the military strategies and such, but I wanted to understand how it
impacted the Japanese people from an empathetic perspective. **Hiroshima**, by John Hersey, provided exactly that
with the powerful stories of six people, innocent civilians whose lives were forever changed. 

The book is well written and presents the survivor's true experiences in the story-telling manner of a fictional work,
pulling the reader in and keeping them engaged. It was an emotional read, often a difficult one given the horrors
they experienced, yet such an important perspective in understanding how the decision impacted hundreds of thousands of
people, mostly civilians. Having read this, it made our visit to the
[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Park) and
[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Museum) so much more
impactful to me, personally.

A year after the bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan was still under U.S. military control and information about the
devastating aftermath was highly restricted. Propaganda in the U.S. reported minimal deaths and minor health issues
for some survivors, but the reality was starkly different. There were an estimated 90,000 to 166,000 dead by the end
of the year and tens of thousands of survivors living with the effects of radiation poisoning for the remainder of their
lives.

The real impact of the horrific event was revealed by John Hersey, a reporter who traveled to the demolished city
and interviewed six survivors a year afterwards. The book was initially published in The New Yorker in 1946, when
the editors chose to forgo their usual format and devote the complete issue to Hersey's four articles—they were published
as a book less than two months later. In 1985, forty years later, Hersey tracked down the original six survivors
and interviewed them again, discovering how their lives had gone since. Those stories comprise the fifth chapter,
"The Aftermath", that was added to the book in later editions.

[![Wool (Silo #1), by Hugh Howey](/images/cover_Silo_HughHowey_150.jpg "Wool (Silo #1), by Hugh Howey"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780358447849)

I first read the **Silo** series, by Hugh Howey, in 2017 and thoroughly enjoyed it. After watching the excellent
series adaptation on Apple TV, my wife wanted to read the books and I joined her for a reread. Not only were they fun
to read again, but it was interesting to see the differences between the books and the TV series. I'm not a purist
when it comes to translating books into visual media; I like to give the artists (actors, directors, writers, etc.)
the freedom to interpret the original work into their own. There are two questions I ask myself in these situations:
did I enjoy it and did they remain true to the spirit of the original. In this case, we did and they most certainly
have.

*   [Wool (Silo #1)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780358447849)
*   [Shift (Silo #2)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780544839649)
*   [Dust (Silo #3)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780544838260)

The first book in the Silo trilogy, Wool puts the reader in a dystopian society that is unique to others in the genre. Howey throws you right into the story with a fair mix of action, drama, and no shortage of suspense. The characters have their personality traits, yet grow as the plot unfolds. An enjoyable, suspenseful, interesting read with plenty of plot twists.

The second book in the Silo trilogy, Howey tells the story of how it all began. How Silo came about in the first place and who were the architects, both willing and not. I appreciate that Howey told us how it all started, something we're often left wondering (I'm looking at you, Walking Dead). Once again, the story unfolds with well-written action, drama, and suspense. My only criticism is that shifting between the timeframes became tedious, forcing me to mark the chapters (where time changed) to keep track which one I was currently reading.

The third book in the Silo trilogy delivers the same high-quality storytelling as the previous installments. Action, drama, suspense, and character development…all present and well-written. Thank you, Howey, for giving the readers an ending to the story arc.

[![Firekeeper’s Daughter, by Angeline Boulley](/images/cover_FirekeepersDaughter_AngelineBoulley_150.jpg "Firekeeper’s Daughter, by Angeline Boulley"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250866035)

**Firekeeper’s Daughter**, by Angeline Boulley, is not a book I would have selected on my own, but I'm grateful
to have read it and it's one of the more powerful and engaging books I've read this year—big thanks to our book
club for selecting it.

While it starts a bit slow building the environment and establishing the characters, once it gets going (chapter
10ish) things move along at a solid pace. The mysteries continue to grow, evolve, and take unusual turns, with
several clues that I was able to see in retrospect. The main character, Daunis, is interesting and intelligent,
yet struggles with insecurities and self-doubt, as so many of us do. She's relatable, especially as an almost
19-year-old woman who finds herself dealing with an extreme situation.

I truly enjoyed being immersed in the Ojibwe culture and language. The author explains practices, events, and
the language in ways that are instructive and interesting without bogging down the story. I appreciate how
Boulley doesn't shy away from the themes of racism, sexual assault, honoring culture and traditions, and how
much they impact indigenous peoples in the U.S. and Canada. It stand on its own as a mystery novel and the
author elevates the story by immersing us in the Ojibwe culture.
