**Redshirts**, by [John Scalzi](https://whatever.scalzi.com/), is a clever and fun ode to those poor saps
on the original [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series) who wore red
uniforms and _never_ seemed to survive the away missions.

**Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism**, by Sarah Wynn-Williams

Similar to one of my [top reads](https://todhilton.com/reads/top-reads-2024) from last year
([Exit Interview](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780374600907), by Kristi Coulter), this memoir is an expose of a
technology company that has grown to have an unbelievable amount of influence and control on the world, Meta (known
more prominently as Facebook).

Notes:
 - Reveals her insecurities
 - Admits to staying after she began realizing (or, rather, accepting) how she was being treated and Mark's view on
   the world and his greed
 - Her boss (Joel) taking their virtual one-on-one meetings from his bed
 - [My theory, not Sarah's] Mark Zuckerberg has arrested development


Page 5 - But most days, working on policy at Facebook was way less like enacting a chapter from Machiavelli and
way more like watching a bunch of fourteen-year-olds who’ve been given superpowers and an ungodly
amount of money, as they jet around the world to figure out what power has bought and brought them.

Page 68 - The music rolls over us and the dance floor pulses. Javi drains his drink, pulls me into the fray, and
gestures for Juan to join us. We edge as close as we can get to Hillary Clinton.

Page 97 - It’s just Sheryl Sandberg (COO who wrote Lean In), in an arbitrary flex of power. That seems to 
be how she operates, unpredictable, keeping us all on edge. Never quite knowing when she’ll strike, so we’re
never tempted to push any boundaries, even the simplest ones.

Page 105 - They don’t discuss the real secret behind maintaining their work-life balance, mothering as if they don’t
have children: it’s undergirded by their multimillion-dollar paychecks.

Page 106 - My issue is the expectation from my bosses that breasts can be turned on and off like a faucet and I can
breastfeed anywhere, anytime. And I really mean anywhere.

Page 118 - Facebook’s leaders aren’t the people I hoped they were. And in retrospect, I should have thought a lot
harder about this fact than I did.

Page 201 - At this point I’m still a true believer in Facebook’s mission to change the world. And I had thought my
role in it—my contribution—would be to get Mark to engage internationally, meet with real heads of
state. I thought that would teach him to exercise political power responsibly. Make reasonable
compromises when needed, on privacy, protecting children, and whatever mattered. Build a company
that would make money, sure, but also be a good citizen of the world. But now it occurs to me that
maybe Mark isn’t on the same page at all.

Page 225 - (In 2016) I’m still clinging to the ever-diminishing hope that we’ll drop the street fighter tactics and start to
engage in a much more open conversation with governments about how social media should operate in
their countries. In other words, grow up

Page 228 - This was the proposal that we should use the election support and campaign tools we were offering to
US presidential candidates (and that Donald Trump was using aggressively in his 2016 campaign)—and
offer them to the Alternative für Deutschland, the far right in Germany, and to Marine Le Pen and the
Front National, the far right in France. Getting closer to these political parties and helping them into
government would be the most effective way to stop governments from regulating Facebook.

Page 235 - Five years earlier when I arrived at Facebook, Mark didn’t have a theory of how he and the company
should be in the world; he didn’t really have developed opinions about policy or politics, beyond “sign up
more users.” The rest of Facebook’s leadership wasn’t very different. Mark really couldn’t be bothered to
care. Now he’s developed priorities, and they’re mostly pretty horrible and ignorant of the human costs.

Page 251 - I know that the way he sees it, US politics is outside my expertise and very different from whatever I’m
seeing in what he calls “tin pot” countries like the Philippines, Myanmar, and Thailand. Also, and maybe
more importantly: everyone in this room understands we’re making record amounts of money off the
Trump campaign, with all its misinformation and trolling.

Page 251 - Facebook rewards outsider candidates who post inflammatory content that drives engagement. We
charge less money for ads that are more incendiary and reach more people. Trump is using our system
the way it’s designed to be used. From my point of view, that’s incentivizing and rewarding the worst
kinds of political ugliness.

Page 256 - In the lead-up to the election, this was the constant message inside the company. We called it “the
Facebook election” internally, and the company had committed to dominating this election like no
other. We all know hordes of people across policy, communications, sales, product management, and
engineering who’ve been working full time on elections. In presentations everyone’s been talking for
months about how powerful Facebook is and how effective it is as a tool to influence people and change
minds. How we’re in the “business of democracy.”

Page 260 - a bubble implies flimsy transparency, a diaphanous space where you can see a normal life just beyond
your grasp. And what Mark inhabits is more like a thick opaque dome, a murky fortress that separates
him from the rest of the world. When you have so many other people doing things for you
professionally and personally, you stop taking responsibility for any of it.

Page 264 - Over the course of the ten-hour flight to Lima, Elliot patiently explains to Mark all the ways that
Facebook basically handed the election to Donald Trump. It’s pretty fucking convincing and pretty
fucking concerning.

Page 265 - Trump heavily outspent Clinton on Facebook ads. In the weeks before the election, the Trump campaign
was regularly one of the top advertisers on Facebook globally. His campaign could afford to do this
because the data targeting enabled it to raise millions each month in campaign contributions through
Facebook. In fact, Facebook was the Trump campaign’s largest source of cash.

Obama warned Zuckerberg
Page 275 - “Fake news, he kept going on about fake news and misinformation,” Mark steams. “He doesn’t get it. He’
s got it totally wrong, totally out of proportion. He said that Facebook’s playing a destructive role
globally. And I think he actually believes that.”
Page 275 - “Warning me,” he repeats, incensed. Angry that Obama had taken him to task on the role Facebook had
played in the election and beyond.
Page 285 - This trip is one of many moments where Mark could have gone a different way. Could have been
convinced by a different path. But something else kicked in. After all the headlines saying he was in
denial about the election, after being shit on by Obama, he dug in. He’s not built to take criticism like
that and genuinely try to understand and fix the problems the 2016 election exposed, wield his power
responsibly. That’s not who he is. He’s defiant. He’ll show them. And in the middle of all that, he stands
on a stage full of the most powerful people in the world, and they dote over him like some boy king.

Page 335 - Facebook does work for a beauty product company tracking when thirteen-to-seventeen-year-old girls
delete selfies, so it can serve a beauty ad to them at that moment. ... The weird thing is that the rest of
our Facebook coworkers seem unbothered about this.

Page 342 - Despite its public statement to the contrary, Facebook was long aware that its research, models, and
programs sought to optimize user engagement at all costs. Facebook employed a series of “addictive by
design” features specifically targeted and tailored to exploiting the vulnerabilities of young users, while
hiding the risky and harmful nature of such features. Forcing every lever to drive engagement and drive
that addiction.

Page 343 - After the election, and with all the other problems coming to light, they could’ve decided to genuinely
clean things up. Instead they create some window-dressing “fact checking partnerships” and, before
long, some of the main “partners,” Snopes and the Associated Press, pull out. 
A different fact-checker who had long worked for Facebook vents their frustration to the Guardian:
“They are a terrible company and, on a personal level, I don’t want to have anything to do with them.”

Page 361 - Things are bad, but the one saving grace so far has been that Joel and I are not in the same office or even
the same state. So his behavior has so far been limited by geography to creepy questions and taking our
one-on-one meetings in bed.

Page 372 - So that’s how it ended for me at Facebook. I faced the behavior so many women at Facebook and other
tech firms have faced. I wasn’t silent enough. But if they hadn’t thrown me out, I wouldn’t have lasted
much longer at the company anyway. I had told myself I could do more on the inside than the outside,
but realistically, being the grit in the machine wasn’t working.

Page 374 - The more they see of the consequences of their actions, the less of a fuck Mark and Facebook’s leadership
give.
They were in the rare situation where the money was there in abundance. They could have afforded to
do the right thing. They could have told the truth. They could have exercised basic human decency. It
was all within their power.

[![Firekeeper’s Daughter, by Angeline Boulley](/images/cover_FirekeepersDaughter_AngelineBoulley_150.jpg "Firekeeper’s Daughter, by Angeline Boulley"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250866035)

**Firekeeper’s Daughter**, by Angeline Boulley, is not a book I would have selected on my own, but I'm grateful
to have read it and it's one of the more powerful and engaging books I've read this year—big thanks to our book
club for selecting it.

While it starts a bit slow building the environment and establishing the characters, once it gets going (chapter
10ish) things move along at a solid pace. The mysteries continue to grow, evolve, and take unusual turns, with
several clues that I was able to see in retrospect. The main character, Daunis, is interesting and intelligent,
yet struggles with insecurities and self-doubt, as so many of us do. She's relatable, especially as an almost
19-year-old woman who finds herself dealing with an extreme situation.

I truly enjoyed being immersed in the Ojibwe culture and language. The author explains practices, events, and
the language in ways that are instructive and interesting without bogging down the story. I appreciate how
Boulley doesn't shy away from the themes of racism, sexual assault, honoring culture and traditions, and how
much they impact indigenous peoples in the U.S. and Canada. It stand on its own as a mystery novel and the
author elevates the story by immersing us in the Ojibwe culture.
