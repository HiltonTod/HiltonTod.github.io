**Redshirts**, by [John Scalzi](https://whatever.scalzi.com/), is a clever and fun ode to those poor saps
on the original [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series) who wore red
uniforms and _never_ seemed to survive the away missions.

Similar to one of my [top reads](https://todhilton.com/reads/top-reads-2024) from last year
([Exit Interview](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780374600907), by Kristi Coulter), this memoir is an expose of a
technology company that has grown to have an unbelievable amount of influence and control on the world, Meta (known
more prominently as Facebook).

DRAFT

Before our bucket-list trip to the city of Hiroshima in Japan, I wanted to learn more about the atomic bomb that was
dropped by the United States military during World War II, on August 6, 1945. There are numerous books about the
bombings, the Manhattan Project, Enola Gay, the military strategies and such, but I wanted to understand how it
impacted the Japanese people from an empathetic perspective. **Hiroshima**, by John Hersey, provided exactly that
with the powerful stories of six people, innocent civilians whose lives were forever changed.

Japan was still under U.S. military control and information about the bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the
devastating aftermath, was highly restricted. Propaganda in the U.S. reported minimal deaths and minor health issues
for some survivors, but the reality was starkly different. There were an estimated 90,000 to 166,000 dead by the end
of the year and tens of thousands of survivors living with the effects of radiation poisoning for the remainder of their
lives.

The real impact of the horrific event was discovered by John Hersey, a reporter who traveled to the demolished city
and interviewed six survivors a year afterwards. The book was initially published in The New Yorker in 1946, when
the editors chose to forgo their usual format and devote the complete issue to Hersey's articles—it was published
as a book less than two months later. In 1985, forty years later, Hersey tracked down the original six survivors
and interviewed them again, discovering how their lives had gone since.

[![Firekeeper’s Daughter, by Angeline Boulley](/images/cover_FirekeepersDaughter_AngelineBoulley_150.jpg "Firekeeper’s Daughter, by Angeline Boulley"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250866035)

**Firekeeper’s Daughter**, by Angeline Boulley, is not a book I would have selected on my own, but I'm grateful
to have read it and it's one of the more powerful and engaging books I've read this year—big thanks to our book
club for selecting it.

While it starts a bit slow building the environment and establishing the characters, once it gets going (chapter
10ish) things move along at a solid pace. The mysteries continue to grow, evolve, and take unusual turns, with
several clues that I was able to see in retrospect. The main character, Daunis, is interesting and intelligent,
yet struggles with insecurities and self-doubt, as so many of us do. She's relatable, especially as an almost
19-year-old woman who finds herself dealing with an extreme situation.

I truly enjoyed being immersed in the Ojibwe culture and language. The author explains practices, events, and
the language in ways that are instructive and interesting without bogging down the story. I appreciate how
Boulley doesn't shy away from the themes of racism, sexual assault, honoring culture and traditions, and how
much they impact indigenous peoples in the U.S. and Canada. It stand on its own as a mystery novel and the
author elevates the story by immersing us in the Ojibwe culture.
