**Redshirts**, by [John Scalzi](https://whatever.scalzi.com/), is a clever and fun ode to those poor saps
on the original [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series) who wore red
uniforms and _never_ seemed to survive the away missions.

[![Firekeeper’s Daughter, by Angeline Boulley](/images/cover_FirekeepersDaughter_AngelineBoulley_150.jpg "Firekeeper’s Daughter, by Angeline Boulley"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250866035)

**Firekeeper’s Daughter** is not a book I would have selected on my own, but I'm grateful to have read it and it's one of the more powerful and engaging books I've read this year—big thanks to our book club for selecting it.

While it starts a bit slow building the environment and establishing the characters, once it gets going (chapter 10ish) things move along at a solid pace. The mysteries continue to grow, evolve, and take unusual turns, with several clues that I was able to see in retrospect. The main character, Daunis, is interesting and intelligent, yet struggles with insecurities and self-doubt, as so many of us do. She's relatable, especially as an almost-19 year old woman who finds herself dealing with an extreme situation.

I truly enjoyed being immersed in the Ojibwe culture and language. The author explains practices, events, and the language in ways that are instructive and interesting without bogging down the story. I appreciate how Boulley doesn't shy away from the themes of racism, sexual assault, honoring culture and traditions, and how much they impact indigenous peoples in the U.S. and Canada. It stand on its own as a mystery novel and the author elevates the story by immersing us in the Ojibwe culture.
