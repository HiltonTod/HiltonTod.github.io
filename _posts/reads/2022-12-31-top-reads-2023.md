In no particular order, these are some of my favorite [books that I read in 2023](/reads/books/#2023).

1. _[Giant Days (Vol. 1)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781608867899), by John Allison, Whitney Cogar, & Lissa Treiman_ ++
   <details><summary>A thoroughly fun...</summary>A thoroughly fun, quirky, and enjoyable story of 3 young women's friendships and adventures during their college (university) years. It had me nostalgic for my college days, not only the adventures similar to theirs, but the ones that were different and unique from mine. For those yet to attend university, here's a taste of what it can be like and a reminder to be courageous, find those friendships and experiences that will be the building blocks of adulthood!<br><br>Note for the 'Extra Credit' and 'Early Registration' volumes: They're still good, but not quite as much so as the original volumes 1-14. You can read them anytime, but I recommend finishing at least volume 1 of the primary/main track first.<br><br></details>
1. [Legendborn (Book 1): Legendborn](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534441613), by Tracy Deonn ++
   <details><summary>A fantastic Arthurian-inspired tale...</summary>A fantastic Arthurian-inspired tale of a Black teenage girl from North Carolina who finds herself entrenched in a prophecy that she didn't know about and definitely didn't want to be a part of. Deonn builds a uniquely interesting world around the Legends of King Arthur, full of complexity and intrigue with characters that grow and adapt with the story. I sincerely appreciate how Deonn presents Bree, the main character, and the many experiences that are unique precisely because she's a young Black woman who often has to deal with microaggressions and racism.<br><br></details>
1. [Legendborn (Book 2): Bloodmarked](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534441637), by Tracy Deonn ++
   <details><summary>This second book...</summary>This second book in the Legendborn series continues the tale of a Black teenage girl from North Carolina, Bree, who finds herself entrenched in an Arthurian-inspired prophecy. Deonn continues to build on and explain the complexities of the magical world around Bree. There were several unexpected plot twists and the characters continue to evolve in interesting ways. Once again, I appreciate Deonn's tie-ins to the history of enslaved people in the U.S. and how it continues to impact our culture. She integrates that history into the storyline with depth, care, and respect.<br><br></details>
1. [Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780393347777), by Charles Wheelan ++
   <details><summary>Wheelan brings brevity and clarity...</summary>Wheelan brings brevity and clarity to a tedious subject matter, statistical analysis. This is nothing like the textbook for my statistics class in college, which might be why I actually read this one cover-to-cover. Wheelan adeptly translates advanced concepts into real-world situations using clear language and intuitive examples. I found the silly sense of humor enjoyable, but I can see where it might bother some folks. All in all, I found it informative and often enjoyable to read, which given the subject matter is a formidable accomplishment, one to be lauded!<br><br>"Statistics is like a high-caliber weapon: helpful when used correctly and potentially disastrous in the wrong hands."<br><br></details>
1. _[The Sixth Gun (Vol. 1): Cold Dead Fingers](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781620104200), by Collen Bunn, Brian Hurtt, & Bill Crabtree_ ++
   <details><summary>Action packed spaghetti western...</summary>Action packed spaghetti western with a supernatural twist (or three). The art and writing both have a noir style that reveals the ambiguity and underlying complexity of the characters. The first book of nine, this is a solid introduction to what looks to be a wild and entertaining ride.<br><br></details>
1. [Witch King](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250826794), by Martha Wells ++
   <details><summary>As usual, Martha Wells packs a whole helluva lot...</summary>As usual, Martha Wells packs a whole helluva lot into each sentence, paragraph, and chapter throughout this book. The author creates worlds with complexities and challenges that mirror our own, yet also fills them with common practices and ethos that break many stereotypes of our reality. She throws you into the deep end first by starting the story off where she does and I don't disagree with some reviewers who said they would have appreciated a bit of backstory or history to prepare them for the ride. Having said that, she does a fantastic job of laying out the story over time, exposing us to the characters and moments of their growth—historical and present time. I'm excited to see where Wells takes this story and how Kai, Ziede, Tahren, and the others evolve!<br><br>Martha Wells solidified herself as one of my all-time favorite authors when I devoured the Murderbot series in 2020 and followed it up with the Books of Raksura in 2021. Whether it's sci-fi or fantasy, Wells creates extensive and detailed worlds that build off of our own emotional journeys while adding unique and interesting twists. Worth calling out, I truly appreciate the equity that Wells builds into her fictional worlds, whether it's queer relationships or gender presentation, she presents openness and acceptance as the norm.<br><br>A well-written review: <a href="https://www.tor.com/2023/05/31/book-review-witch-king-by-martha-wells/">A Lavish, Crunchy Fantasy: Witch King by Martha Wells</a><br><br></details>
1. [City of Bones](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250861672), by Martha Wells ++
   <details><summary>A skillfully crafted story...</summary>A skillfully crafted story set in a richly constructed society set thousands of years after apocalyptic events drastically change the planet—that is presumably Earth. As I've come to expect, Wells develops characters with intricacy and depth, allowing us to witness their subtle evolution as the story unfolds. The plot flows well and the characters are engaging. It's truly a pleasure to read.<br><br>A personal side note: I had the joy of seeing Martha Wells speak at a local book store and sign my copy of the newly revised edition of City of Bones.<br><br></details>
1. ALMOST DONE [Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780525521044), by Bono ++
1. DONE [The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music](https://a.co/d/c5dbXeL) (audiobook), by Dave Grohl ++ (reread)
1. [Starter Villain](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780765389220), by John Scalzi ++
   <details><summary>One of my best whimsical purchases...</summary>One of my best whimsical purchases in quite some time—at <a href="https://www.bookpeople.com/">BookPeople</a> in Austin, Texas. The book is ridiculously entertaining and lighthearted! A fast-paced story where the protagonist is a fish out of water, suddenly entangled with a small group of elitist thick-headed billionaire tech bros who truly believe they're super villains. There are also adorable cats. What more could you want in a hilarious allegory for income inequality?<br><br></details>
1. ALMOST DONE [Dancing in the Mosque: An Afghan Mother's Letter to Her Son](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780062970329), by Homeira Qaderi ++

<p align="center">~ ~ ~</p>

[![The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music, by Dave Grohl](/images/cover_TheStoryteller_DaveGrohl_150.jpg "The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music, by Dave Grohl"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780063076099)

**The Storyteller** was one of my [top reads of 2022](/reads/top-reads-2022/) and when we decided to
take a 2-day road trip, listening to Dave Grohl narrate the [audiobook](https://a.co/d/c5dbXeL) was
a no-brainer. It was like listening to him rattle off stories as we drove 1,200 miles across three
states, stopping at diners for greasy food, and truck stops to fill the gas tank. Both versions of
the book are great, but I recommend listening to the audiobook for the full Dave Grohl experience.

[![Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story, by Bono](/images/cover_Surrender_Bono_150.jpg "Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story, by Bono"){: .align-left }]([https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780593465066](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780525521044))

Continuing in the line of memoirs by famous musicians, [Bono](https://www.one.org/us/person/bono/),
born Paul David Hewson, tells his tale in **Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story**.

Bono's memoir is as poetic as U2's song lyrics, and densely packed with his experiences, introspection,
and interpretation. It's everything any devout fan could hope for when asking the famous lead singer
"how'd you do it and what's it been like?" His writing is eloquent, articulate, expressive, and, yes,
poetic. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the paths he's taken, the relationships he's experienced,
and his drive to make the world a better place through philanthropy and political activism.

Whether or not he calls himself one, Bono is a philosopher. Throughout the book he sprinkles his
ruminations and conversations with others on religion, personal faith, scriptures, and all sorts of
philosophical questions. I appreciate and respect that he openly and routinely questions his own
religious faith as well as the scriptures it's based on. He looks beyond the dogma to understand the
philosophy. I admire that this perspective is evident in his song lyrics and performances.

[![Dancing in the Mosque](/images/cover_DancingInTheMosque_HomeiraQaderi_150.jpg "Dancing in the Mosque, by Homeira Qaderi"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780062970329)

Enlightening, emotional, overwhelming, sorrowful, and hopeful are words I'd use to describe
**Dancing in the Mosque**, by Homeira Qaderi. The hardships she's endured throughout her life are worthy
of the story and she entwines the words with emotion and soul that elevates it beyond any of my
expectations. The experiences she shares are based around letters to her son while they're forcefully
separated—she's in the United States and he's in Afghanistan.

No doubt, Qaderi is an artful storyteller and skilled writer. When you know that everything is her
truth, her life, her experiences, the emphasis of each tale is magnified tenfold, a hundredfold, and
more. It astounds me—and reminds me of my extreme privilege—that she not only lived through so many
horrendous experiences, but had—and still has—the courage to fight for her beliefs and rights in such
circumstances. I have the utmost admiration for her and am thankful that she shared her story, helping
the rest of us in the world understand the experiences of women in Afghanistan.

> the healing ocean.

[![My Body](/images/cover_MyBody_EmilyRatajowski_150.jpg "My Body, by Emily Ratajowski"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250817860)

With **Dear Martin**, [Nic Stone](http://www.nicstone.info/) gives us a modern dramatization of a story
our country (the United States) knows all too well, even if it's often viewed through extremely different
lenses. This is exactly the sort of novel that puts you smack dab in the middle of the situation, building
your empathy for Justyce's experience. The book is geared towards young adults, but I recommend it for
anyone looking for an engaging story about how young Black men can experience racism (realistic fiction).

I also recommend Stone's follow up book, **[Dear Justyce](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781984829696)**,
where an incarcerated teen, Quan, writes letters to Justyce throughout his own experience with racism.

[![One by One, by Ruth Ware](/images/cover_OneByOne_RuthWare_150.jpg "One by One, by Ruth Ware"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781501188824)

[Ruth Ware](https://ruthware.com/)'s **One by One** was a fun and engaging multi-person locked-room (ski
chalet) mystery/thriller! Admittedly, I've worked in the software industry for 22 years and enjoyed that
the characters fit many of the stereotypical software employee archetypes I've encountered over that time.
If I didn't have that connection, this might not have made my list of top reads for the year...but I do,
it is, and here we are.

I didn't take it too seriously and (likely because of that) it was a fun read.

[![Trejo: My Life of Crime, Redemption, and Hollywood, by Danny Trejo & Donal Logue](/images/cover_Trejo_DannyTrejo_150.jpg "Trejo: My Life of Crime, Redemption, and Hollywood, by Danny Trejo & Donal Logue"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781982150839)

**Trejo: My Life of Crime, Redemption, and Hollywood**, by Danny Trejo & Donal Logue, caught me off guard,
I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.

If you've been a movie fan at any point in the last 40 years, you've seen Danny Trejo on-screen (he's been
in 258 movies!). Curiosity was the main driver for me picking up this book. When it comes to celebrities,
Trejo is an enigma, he doesn't fit the stereotype, and I wanted to know more about him as a person. It might
have helped that I savored our stop at [Trejo's Coffee & Donuts](https://www.trejosdonuts.com/) during a
recent family trip to L.A.

His stories are heartfelt, candid, and explicit—he doesn't hold back. Trejo isn't afraid to point out his
own faults, how they've landed him in jail or messed up relationships, and even how he repeated them,
sometimes recognizing the lesson but unwilling/unable to do what he should in those moments. It's
fascinating to hear him tell the tales then analyze how and why they happened or explain his perspective
and motivation at the time. His willingness to revisit and understand his past is refreshing. For example,
he recognizes that toxic masculinity is a running theme throughout his life. He attributes this to both the
patriarchical Chicano culture and the male role models in his childhood embracing that culture so vehemently
(his descriptions, not mine). Trejo doesn't use this as a means of excusing his behavior, but rather to
understand its roots and how to change. Nor does he use this as a means of bashing his culture or the men
in his life, quite the opposite, he dearly loves them.

A few things that I learned.

-   Perhaps unsurprisingly, he really is a bad ass—it's not an act—that has been to prison.
-   Conversely, he's one of the nicest guys in Hollywood, willing to go out of his way to help anyone who
    needs it.
-   His main goal and driving desire in life is to support people going through addiction recovery.
-   He came across acting accidentally, all because he was helping someone work through their addiction.
-   When it comes to acting gigs, he never breaks a commitment and he takes almost every single offer
    (because he's still afraid it might be the last), which has made him one of the most prolific actors
    of our time.
-   This book was co-written with his close friend, [Donal Logue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donal_Logue),
    who is also an actor that you'll likely recognize.

[![The Cartographers, by Peng Shepherd](/images/cover_TheCartographers_PengShepherd_150.jpg "The Cartographers, by Peng Shepherd"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780062910707)

**The Cartographers** was recommended by a friend and immediately intrigued me because...I love maps. I
have several hanging on the walls in my house and whole books dedicated to them. They're more than just
how to get somewhere or even pieces of art, they represent experiences we've had or will have, either in
our minds or real life. So, it's probably to be expected that I would enjoy this type of subject matter,
but that's not the whole of it. 

[Peng Shepherd](http://pengshepherd.com/) has created an entertaining mystery adventure, slightly
reminiscent of Indiana Jones if he'd been a mapmaker instead of an archaeologist (at least to this child
of the 70's and 80's). And along those lines of watching Indy narrowly escape a rolling boulder or retrieve
his hat from the other side of a closing stone door (both about to crush him), I willingly suspended a bit
of disbelief and allowed myself to enjoy the ride.

[![Our Missing Hearts, by Celeste Ng](/images/cover_OurMissingHearts_CelesteNg_150.jpg "Our Missing Hearts, by Celeste Ng"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780593492543)

[Celeste Ng](https://www.celesteng.com/)'s (pronounced “ing”) **Little Fires Everywhere** made my
[top reads of 2021](/reads/top-reads-2021/), so I was intrigued when I discovered her follow up book,
**Our Missing Hearts**. Steven King's review in the
[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/books/review/celeste-ng-our-missing-hearts.html)
further prompted me to read it. Here are a few of his thoughts.

>   Before the Crisis, Bird’s father was a linguist. Now he works in a library, shelving books. In Ng’s
>   version of the American Nightmare, there’s no need to burn books. “We pulp them,” a helpful librarian
>   tells Bird. (Bird doesn’t tell her he’s picturing book bonfires, but she intuits it.) “Much more
>   civilized, right? Mash them up, recycle them into toilet paper. Those books wiped someone’s rear end
>   a long time ago.”

>   On another level, “Our Missing Hearts” is a meditation on the sometimes accidental power of words.
>   Why are Mr. Gardner’s library shelves so empty? Because students must not have access to books that
>   “might expose them to dangerous ideas.” This isn’t dystopian fiction but actual fact, as rancorous
>   school curriculum meetings and protests across the United States have proved. 

>   Ng succeeds...partly because her outrage is contained and focused, and mostly because she is often
>   captivated by the very words she is using. Bird’s father’s oldest habit, we’re told, is “taking words
>   apart like old clocks to show the gears still ticking inside.” The gears in this story for the most
>   part mesh very well. And Bird is a brave and believable character, who gives us a relatable portal
>   into a world that seems more like our own every day.

Suffice it to say that I thoroughly enjoyed **Our Missing Hearts** and Celeste Ng is becoming one of
my favorite authors.

[![Do Hard Things, by Steve Magness](/images/cover_DoHardThings_SteveMagness_150.jpg "Do Hard Things, by Steve Magness"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780063098626)

Finally, we can dispense with the "fake toughness that is: control- and power-driven, developed through
fear, fueled by insecurity, and based on appearance over substance."

This book resonated with me. I played sports when I was younger and have always been fairly competetive,
yet it never made sense to me when coaches told us to deal with (or ignore) the pain and play through it.
That was our body telling us that something was starting to go wrong and the coaches were telling us to
ignore those warnings.

In **Do Hard Things: Why We Get Resilience Wrong and the Surprising Science of Real Toughness**,
[Steve Magness](stevemagness.com) contrasts society's perpetuating misinterpretation of toughness with
his four pillars of _real_ toughness, based on the studies and research he's evaluated. 

-   Pillar 1: Ditch the Facade, Embrace Reality
-   Pillar 2: Listen to Your Body
-   Pillar 3: Respond Instead of React
-   Pillar 4: Transcend Discomfort

The pillars are further broken down into chapters, where the names tell you almost exactly what to expect.
_How we took the wrong lessons from the military_ explains how the military builds up recruits and teaches
them how to handle the stress before submitting them to it. _True confidence is quiet; insecurity is loud_
describes how our inner narrative impacts our confidence and ability to manage adversity. _Your emotions
are messengers, not dictators_ emphasizes that feelings serve as our first line of defense and help us make
better decisions. _Keep your mind steady_ advocates for opening ourselves up to discomfort, not ignoring it,
which better positions us to handle those hard moments.

I appreciate that the author sprinkles _TOUGHNESS MAXIMS_ throughout the book; short summaries of ideas
that deliver powerful messages worth remembering. Here are a few that stood out to me.

>   Real toughness is experiencing discomfort or distress, leaning in, paying attention, and creating space
>   to take thoughtful action. It’s navigating discomfort to make the best decision you can.

>   Embrace reality. Accurate appraisal of demands + accurate appraisal of our abilities.

>   When we don’t have control, we lose the capacity to cope. It’s when we have a choice that toughness is trained.

>   Feelings send a message, conveying information and nudging us toward a behavior.

>   Tough individuals learn to match perception with reality so that they marshal the appropriate response
>   instead of an exaggerated one.

And one particular lesson that I found fascinating (and agree with), especially as an introvert who spends
a lot of time alone with the thoughts meandering around in my skull and considers himself fairly resilient.

>   The skill of being alone in your head is a foundational piece of developing toughness.

[![The Hobbit & Lord of the Rings (trilogy), by J.R.R. Tolkien](/images/cover_Hobbit_JRRTolkien_150.jpg "The Hobbit & Lord of the Rings (trilogy), by J.R.R. Tolkien"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780547928227)

**The Hobbit** and **The Lord of the Rings** trilogy were my introduction into the world of epic fantasy.
At the ripe age of 12, while on a cross-country road trip in an 18-wheeler with my family (my dad owned a
furniture-moving business at the time and would often take the rest of us on the road with him in the
summers), my restlessness and boredom prompted my step-mother to suggest **The Hobbit** while visiting a
truck stop. I devoured it in a day and promptly asked for MORE OF THIS. We were able to find the three
books that make up **The Lord of the Rings** and I finished those in a few more days. Then I immediately
read them again. And I've re-read them at least a dozen times over the years since.
