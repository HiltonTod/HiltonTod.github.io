In no particular order, these are some of my favorite [books that I read in 2022](/reads/books/#2022).

[![The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music, by Dave Grohl](/images/cover_TheStoryteller_DaveGrohl_150.jpg "The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music, by Dave Grohl"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780063076099)

**The Storyteller** was such a comfortable read. It felt like I was listening to Dave Grohl rattle off stories as we sat around the fire pit in my backyard drinking beer on a clear-skied, brisk Saturday night. His writing style is casual, humble, and entertaining. Dave discusses loving his mother, music, fatherhood, and friendships, all being extremely important to him.

Synchronicity is a theme that runs through each and every story; the universe bringing together apparently disconnected events, either within a matter of minutes or sometimes decades. He does an admirable job of carrying a single thread through the tapestry of a story, weaving it in and out of seemingly different events, tying them together in often unexpected ways.

This is a must read if you love music, family, and how our lives evolve in unexpected ways. Since Dave narrates the audio book, I think that will be a must-listen sometime in the future.

Full disclosure: the Foo Fighters are my _if-you-could-only-listen-to-one-band-for-the-rest-of-your-life_ band and Dave Grohl seems like one of the kindest celebrities on the planet. Needless to say, I pre-ordered this when I saw it announced (2021)...and then it sat on my shelf for several months. There always seemed to be 'just one more book' to finish before starting this memoir. And then Taylor Hawkins died unexpectedly in March 2022, which is when I knew it was time to start this journey with Dave. I couldn't have chosen a better way to honor Taylor's life, the last 25 years of which he was Dave's best friend. They lived life together to its fullest, being just as goofy as any of us normal folk. Reading Dave's stories of friendship and love for Taylor were bittersweet, making me tear up with joy hearing their stories and sorrow knowing there wouldn't be any more for the two of them.

[![Call Us What We Carry, by Amanda Gorman](/images/cover_CallUsWhatWeCarry_AmandaGorman_150.jpg "Call Us What We Carry, by Amanda Gorman"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780593465066)

Amanda Gorman give us such a lovely collection of poetry in **Call Us What We Carry**. She provides insights into oppression, feminism, race, and other sociological topics with words that flow so well, you'll hardly realize their serious nature until you're pulled in so deeply that you don't want to stop reading. There's a reason Gorman is the youngest inaugural poet.

I pre-ordered a physical hard cover copy and adore the varied typography and formatting of the different poems on the pages. It's done sparingly and in unique ways, only when it enhances her words. I don't know if the e-book versions have this same formatting, so I recommend reading the physical format for the full experience.

[![My Body](/images/cover_MyBody_EmilyRatajowski_150.jpg "My Body, by Emily Ratajowski"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250817860)

Emily Ratajkowski is a writer, let no one say otherwise. Her collection of essays in **My Body** is well written, entertaining, and insightful.

Emily's life and rise to fame has been filled with insecurities, uncomfortable moments, and privilege. I appreciate that her experiences are described with humility, vulnerability, and a willingness to learn from them. This collection of essays takes us through moments of her life while also giving us an unfettered view into her private thoughts, how she dealt with the anxieties, and the transactions of power she participated in. The dichotomy of being a beautiful woman (as defined by male culture and heavily influenced by her mother) who uses her appearance to earn a living while being insecure about it is ever-present. Especially in her views about the power she has over her body and owning her image, which she describes in varying degrees of confidence. It's fascinating to read her perspective.

[![Dear Martin](/images/cover_DearMartin_NicStone_150.jpg "Dear Martin, by Nic Stone"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781101939529)

With **Dear Martin**, Nic Stone gives us a modern dramatization of a story our country (the United States) knows all too well, even if it's often viewed through extremely different lenses. This is exactly the sort of novel that puts you smack dab in the middle of the situation, building your empathy for Justyce's experience. The book is geared towards young adults, but I recommend it for anyone looking for an engaging story (realistic fiction) about how young Black men can experience racism.

I also recommend Stone's follow up book, **[Dear Justyce](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781984829696)**, where an incarcerated teen, Quan, writes letters to Justyce throughout his own experience with racism.

[![One by One, by Ruth Ware](/images/cover_OneByOne_RuthWare_150.jpg "One by One, by Ruth Ware"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781501188824)

Ruth Ware's **One by One** was a fun and engaging multi-person locked-room (ski chalet) mystery/thriller! Admittedly, I've worked in the software industry for 22 years and enjoyed that the characters fit many of the stereotypical software employee archetypes I've encountered over that time. If I didn't have that connection, this might not have made my list of top reads for the year...but I do, it is, and here we are. I didn't take it too seriously and (likely because of that) it was a fun read.

[![Trejo: My Life of Crime, Redemption, and Hollywood, by Danny Trejo & Donal Logue](/images/cover_Trejo_DannyTrejo_150.jpg "Trejo: My Life of Crime, Redemption, and Hollywood, by Danny Trejo & Donal Logue"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781982150839)

**Trejo: My Life of Crime, Redemption, and Hollywood**, by Danny Trejo & Donal Logue, caught me off guard, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. If you've been a movie fan at any point in the last 40 years, you've seen Danny Trejo on-screen (he's been in 258 movies!). Curiosity was the main driver for me picking up this book. When it comes to celebrities, Trejo is an enigma, he doesn't fit the stereotype, and I wanted to know more about him as a person. It might have helped that I savored our stop at [Trejo's Coffee & Donuts](https://www.trejosdonuts.com/) during a recent family trip to L.A.

His stories are heartfelt, candid, and explicit—he doesn't hold back. Trejo isn't afraid to point out his own faults, how they've landed him in jail or messed up relationships, and even how he repeated them, sometimes recognizing the lesson but unwilling/unable to do what he should in those moments. It's fascinating to hear him tell the tales then analyze how and why they happened or explain his perspective and motivation at the time. His willingness to revisit and understand his past is refreshing. For example, he recognizes that toxic masculinity is a running theme throughout his life. He attributes this to both the patriarchical Chicano culture and the male role models in his childhood embracing that culture so vehemently. Trejo doesn't use this as a means of excusing his behavior, but rather to understand its roots and how to change. Nor does he use this as a means of bashing his culture or the men in his life, quite the opposite, he dearly loves them.

A few things that I learned.

-   Perhaps unsurprisingly, he really is a bad ass—it's not an act—that has been to prison.
-   Conversely, he's one of the nicest guys in Hollywood, willing to go out of his way to help anyone who needs it.
-   His main goal and driving desire in life is to support people going through addiction recovery.
-   He came across acting accidentally, all because he was helping someone work through their addiction.
-   When it comes to acting gigs, he never breaks a commitment and he takes almost every single offer (because he's still afraid it might be the last), which has made him one of the most prolific actors of our time.
-   This book was co-written with his close friend, [Donal Logue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donal_Logue), who is also an actor that you'll likely recognize.

[![The Cartographers, by Peng Shepherd](/images/cover_TheCartographers_PengShepherd_150.jpg "The Cartographers, by Peng Shepherd"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780062910707)

**The Cartographers** was recommended by a friend and immediately intrigued me because...I love maps. I have several hanging on the walls in my house and whole books dedicated to them. They're more than just how to get somewhere or even pieces of art, they represent experiences we've had or will have, either in our minds or real life. So, it's probably to be expected that I would enjoy this type of subject matter, but that's not the whole of it. 

Peng Shepherd has created an entertaining mystery adventure, slightly reminiscent of Indiana Jones if he'd been a mapmaker instead of an archaeologist (at least to this child of the 70's and 80's). And along those lines of watching Indy narrowly escape a rolling boulder or retrieve his hat from the other side of a closing stone door (both about to crush him), I willingly suspended a bit of disbelief and allowed myself to enjoy the ride.

>   Maps are love letters written to times and places their makers had explored.
