In no particular order, these are some of my favorite [books that I read in 2022](/reads/books/#2022).

[![The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music, by Dave Grohl](/images/cover_TheStoryteller_DaveGrohl_150.jpg "The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music, by Dave Grohl"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780063076099)

**The Storyteller** was such a comfortable read. It felt like I was listening to Dave Grohl rattle off stories as we sat around the fire pit in my backyard drinking beer on a clear-skied, brisk Saturday night. His writing style is casual, humble, and entertaining. Dave discusses loving his mother, music, fatherhood, and friendships, all being extremely important to him.

Synchronicity is a theme that runs through each and every story; the universe bringing together apparently disconnected events, either within a matter of minutes or sometimes decades. He does an admirable job of carrying a single thread through the tapestry of a story, weaving it in and out of seemingly different events, tying them together in often unexpected ways.

This is a must read if you love music, family, and how our lives evolve in unexpected ways. Since Dave narrates the audio book, I think that will be a must-listen sometime in the future.

Full disclosure: the Foo Fighters are my _if-you-could-only-listen-to-one-band-for-the-rest-of-your-life_ band and Dave Grohl seems like one of the kindest celebrities on the planet. Needless to say, I pre-ordered this when I saw it announced (2021)...and then it sat on my shelf for several months. There always seemed to be 'just one more book' to finish before starting this memoir. And then Taylor Hawkins died unexpectedly in March 2022, which is when I knew it was time to start this journey with Dave. I couldn't have chosen a better way to honor Taylor's life, the last 25 years of which he was Dave's best friend. They lived life together to its fullest, being just as goofy as any of us normal folk. Reading Dave's stories of friendship and love for Taylor were bittersweet, making me tear up with joy hearing their stories and sorrow knowing there wouldn't be any more for the two of them.

[![Call Us What We Carry, by Amanda Gorman](/images/cover_CallUsWhatWeCarry_AmandaGorman_150.jpg "Call Us What We Carry, by Amanda Gorman"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780593465066)

Amanda Gorman give us such a lovely collection of poetry in **Call Us What We Carry**. She provides insights into oppression, feminism, race, and other sociological topics with words that flow so well, you'll hardly realize their serious nature until you're pulled in so deeply that you don't want to stop reading. There's a reason Gorman is the youngest inaugural poet.

I pre-ordered a physical hard back copy and adore the varied typography and formatting of the different poems on the pages. It's done sparingly and in unique ways, only when it enhances her words. I don't know if the e-book versions have this same formatting and recommend reading them in the physical format for the full experience.

[![My Body](/images/cover_MyBody_EmilyRatajowski_150.jpg "My Body, by Emily Ratajowski"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250817860)

Emily Ratajkowski is a writer, let no one say otherwise. Her collection of essays in **My Body** is well written, entertaining, and insightful.

Emily's life and rise to fame has been filled with insecurities, uncomfortable moments, and privilege. I appreciate that her experiences are described with humility, vulnerability, and a willingness to learn from them. This collection of essays takes us through moments of her life while also giving us an unfettered view into her private thoughts, how she dealt with the anxieties, and the transactions of power she participated in. The dichotomy of being a beautiful woman (as defined by male culture and heavily influenced by her mother) who uses her appearance to earn a living while being insecure about it is ever-present. Especially in her views about the power she has over her body and owning her image, which she describes in varying degrees of confidence. It's fascinating to read her perspective.

[![Dear Martin](/images/cover_DearMartin_NicStone_150.jpg "Dear Martin, by Nic Stone"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781101939529)

With **Dear Martin**, Nic Stone gives us a modern dramatization of a story our country (the United States) knows all too well, even if it's often viewed through extremely different lenses. This is exactly the sort of novel that puts you smack dab in the middle of the situation, building your empathy for Justyce's experience. The book is geared towards young adults, but I recommend it for anyone looking for an engaging story (realistic fiction) about how young Black men can experience racism.

I also recommend Stone's follow up book, **[Dear Justyce](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781984829696)**, where an incarcerated teen, Quan, writes letters to Justyce throughout his own experience with racism.

[![One by One, by Ruth Ware](/images/cover_OneByOne_RuthWare_150.jpg "One by One, by Ruth Ware"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781501188824)

Ruth Ware's **One by One** was a fun and engaging multi-person locked-room (ski chalet) mystery/thriller! Admittedly, I've worked in the software industry for 22 years and enjoyed that the characters fit many of the stereotypical software employee archetypes I've encountered over that time. If I didn't have that connection, this might not have made my list of top reads for the year...but I do, it is, and here we are. I didn't take it too seriously and (likely because of that) it was a fun read.

[![Trejo: My Life of Crime, Redemption, and Hollywood, by Danny Trejo & Donal Logue](/images/cover_Trejo_DannyTrejo_150.jpg "Trejo: My Life of Crime, Redemption, and Hollywood, by Danny Trejo & Donal Logue"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781982150839)

**Trejo: My Life of Crime, Redemption, and Hollywood**, by Danny Trejo & Donal Logue, caught me off guard, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. If you've been a movie fan at any point in the last 40 years, you've seen Danny Trejo on-screen (he's been in 258 movies!). Curiosity was the main driver for me picking up this book. When it comes to celebrities, Trejo is an enigma, he doesn't fit the stereotype, and I wanted to know more about him as a person. It might have helped that I savored our stop at [Trejo's Coffee & Donuts](https://www.trejosdonuts.com/) during a recent family trip to L.A.

His stories are heartfelt, candid, and explicit—he doesn't hold back. Trejo isn't afraid to point out his own faults, how they've landed him in jail or messed up relationships, and even how he repeated them, sometimes recognizing the lesson but unwilling/unable to do what he should in those moments. It's fascinating to hear him tell the tales then analyze how and why they happened or explain his perspective and motivation at the time. His willingness to revisit and understand his past is refreshing. For example, he recognizes that toxic masculinity is a running theme throughout his life. He attributes this to both the patriarchical Chicano culture and the male role models in his childhood embracing that culture so vehemently. Trejo doesn't use this as a means of excusing his behavior, but rather to understand its roots and how to change. Nor does he use this as a means of bashing his culture or the men in his life, quite the opposite, he dearly loves his culture and the men in his life.

A few things that I learned.

-   Perhaps unsurprisingly, he really is a bad ass—it's not an act—that has been to prison.
-   Conversely, he's one of the nicest guys in Hollywood, willing to go out of his way to help anyone who needs it.
-   His main goal and driving desire in life is to support people going through addiction recovery.
-   He came across acting accidentally, all because he was helping someone work through their addiction.
-   When it comes to acting gigs, he never breaks a commitment and he takes almost every single offer (because he's still afraid it might be the last), which has made him one of the most prolific actors of our time.
-   This book was co-written with his close friend, [Donal Logue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donal_Logue), who is also an actor that you'll likely recognize.

# THE END - OLD STUFF TO DELETE BEFORE SUBMITTING
I really enjoyed [Celeste Ng's](https://www.celesteng.com/) **Little Fires Everywhere**, even
more than **Everything I Never Told You** (read in [2020](/reads/books/#2020)). Ng (pronounced
"ing") delivers mystery, suspense, and character depth in complex stories that are
entertaining and engaging.

As a nice bonus, the [series on Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/series/little-fires-everywhere-bce24897-1a74-48a3-95e8-6cdd530dde4c)
is well done and adheres to the source material fairly well. Admittedly, I lean towards
accepting the creative differences that inevitably occur when transitioning stories from
the page to the screen. Thumbs up for both.

[![Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man, by Emmanuel Acho](/images/cover_UncomfortableConversationsWithABlackMan_EmmanuelAcho_150.jpg "Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man, by Emmanuel Acho"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250800466)

**Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man**, by Emmanuel Acho, is one of the most
accessible and pragmatic books I've read on the topic of race. Each chapter is like
you're sitting with him in a coffee shop, casually chatting about these sensitive topics
with a sense of safety and openness. It's particularly refreshing, given that conversations
about race are usually rife with discomfort, misunderstanding, defensiveness, and knee-jerk
reactions (referring to white folks here).

Acho candidly calls out the questions many white people are curious about, yet
too nervous to ask. For instance, chapters named _The Name Game: Black or African
American_, _The False Start: White Privilege_, _The Mythical Me: Angry Black Man_,
and _Shifting the Narrative: Reverse Racism_.
He follows a simple three-part model for each topic and keeps the chapters succinct,
making them fairly quick, digestible reads. Chapters begin by
providing a description and historical perspective (titled _Let's Rewind_), then the
author's interpretation of how it impacts people (titled _Let's Get Uncomfortable_),
and end with pragmatic advice for how to create change (titled _Talk It, Walk It_).

For those beginning their journey of allyship and trying to understand race in
the U.S., this is a great starter. And if you've been educating yourself
on systemic racism for a while now, it's a solid refresher.

I also highly recommend watching the video series that inspired the book,
[Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man](https://uncomfortableconvos.com/).

[![The Raksura series, by Martha Wells](/images/cover_TheCloudRoads_MarthaWells_150.jpg "The Raksura series, by Martha Wells"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781597802161)

[Martha Wells](https://www.marthawells.com/), the same author who brought us a sarcastic,
self-aware security robot in **Murderbot**
(see my [top reads from 2020](/reads/top-reads-2020/)), gives us the fantastic
**Books of the Raksura**. The Raksura are a shape-shifting race, often confused with the
Fell, another shape-shifting race with a much different culture. Wells has built a completely
new world for us to enjoy; one with depth and expansiveness in its geography, societies,
cultures, and peoples. I use the word _peoples_ generically, because Wells doesn't include
humans in the lineup. It's refreshing to approach the main characters without the broad
assumptions we often apply to humans when they're the center of a fantasy world.
The **Books of the Raksura** are entertaining stories with character
arcs that allow the reader to experience their growth and development. The series, in my
recommended reading order:

1.  [The Cloud Roads](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781597802161) (Book 1)
1.  [The Serpent Sea](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781949102291) (Book 2)
1.  [The Siren Depths](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781949102307) (Book 3)
1.  [The Falling World & The Tale of Indigo and Cloud](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781597805353) (Stories, Vol. 1)
1.  [The Dead City & The Dark Earth Below](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H519XJV/) (Stories, Vol. 2)
1.  [The Edge of the Worlds](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781597808972) (Book 4)
1.  [The Harbors of the Sun](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781597809337) (Book 5)

[![A Promised Land, by Barack Obama](/images/cover_APromisedLand_BarackObama_150.jpg "A Promised Land, by Barack Obama"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781524763169)

The longest book I read this year (767 pages!), Barack Obama's **A Promised Land** is
densely packed with details of his life from childhood through most of his first
presidential term. Originally intended to be a single 500-page book, it has turned
into the first of two volumes. While he discusses his young adulthood, relationship
with Michelle, and his early political career, most of the book delves into his time
as President. It was intriguing to read his perspective, not only on the world events
and situations but the high-profile people involved and their behaviors.
Obama allows us to peek behind the curtain and it's fascinating.

Worth noting: After four years of listening to Trump's inept speeches and inflammatory
tweets, it was refreshing to read an (Presidential) author who knows how to use
the English language with such accuracy, fluency, and robustness. Obama is an
excellent writer, filling the pages with information, humor, and life experiences.

[![The Monstress series, by Marjorie Liu & Sana Takeda](/images/cover_MonstressAwakening_MarjorieLiu&SanaTakeda_150.jpg "The Monstress series, by Marjorie Liu & Sana Takeda"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781632157096)

With the Monstress series, [Marjorie Liu](http://marjoriemliu.com/) & 
[Sana Takeda](https://sanatakeda.com/) have created a wondrous and dark world
for us to experience. In the midst of war, they explore friendships, connections to family,
genocide, racism, slavery, politics, and so much more. Even though the topics are often
dark, their expansive imagination is a joy to behold in the story and art.
The series so far:

1.  [Awakening (Vol. 1)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781632157096)
1.  [Haven (Vol. 2)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534300415)
1.  [The Blood (Vol. 3)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534306912)
1.  [The Chosen (Vol. 4)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534313361)
1.  [Warchild (Vol. 5)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534316614)
1.  [The Vow (Vol. 6)](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781534319158)

[![You’ll Never Believe What Happened to Lacey, by Amber Ruffin & Lacey Lamar](/images/cover_YoullNeverBelieveWhatHappenedToLacey_AmberRuffin&LaceyLamar_150.jpg "You’ll Never Believe What Happened to Lacey, by Amber Ruffin & Lacey Lamar"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781538719367)

Enlightening, approachable, and hilariously maddening. Sisters Amber Ruffin and
Lacey Lamar co-wrote these tales of Lacey's experiences as a Black woman that will
have you cringing in exasperation while also laughing-out-loud at their absurdity.

[![Lady Astronaut series, by Mary Robinette Kowal](/images/cover_TheCalculatingStars_MaryRobinetteKowal_150.jpg "Lady Astronaut Universe series, by Mary Robinette Kowal"){: .align-right }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780765378385)

The Lady Astronaut series, by [Mary Robinette Kowal](https://maryrobinettekowal.com/),
is an alternate history of the 1960s where Earth encounters an extinction-level
event when a metorite (not a meteor!) hits the planet. It starts the process of
drastically altering the Earth, exponentially increasing the rate of impending
climate change. Yes, it's as bad as you might think and spurs the world's countries
to work together. Through an engaging story, Kowal intertwines aspects of sexism
and racism that were (even more) rampant in society during the time. The series
so far:

1.  [The Calculating Stars](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780765378385) (Book 1)
1.  [The Fated Sky](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780765398949) (Book 2)
1.  [The Relentless Moon](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9781250236968) (Book 3)

I read **The Silent Patient**, by Alex Michaelides, on a whim when it was recommended
by a co-worker. It didn't disappoint. I enjoy mysteries and this one kept me turning
pages to see what happened next, hoping for a clue to the real story. Admittedly,
the twist ending caught me by surprise. Well done!

[![The Midnight Library, by Matt Haig](/images/cover_TheMidnightLibrary_MattHaig_150.jpg "The Midnight Library, by Matt Haig"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780525559474)

I thoroughly enjoyed the character's journey (journeys, really) and the plot twists
of [Matt Haig's](http://www.matthaig.com/) **The Midnight Library**, even when I saw
some of them coming. An entertaining read!

<p align="center" style="clear:left;">~ ~ ~</p>

[![Project Hail Mary, by Andy Weir](/images/cover_ProjectHailMary_AndyWeir_150.jpg "Project Hail Mary, by Andy Weir"){: .align-left }](https://bookshop.org/a/5270/9780593135204)

I put off reading **Project Hail Mary**, by [Andy Weir](https://www.andyweirauthor.com/),
because many friends had mentioned how **The Martian** was extremely technical and lengthy. I
didn't want to spend my time laboring through scientific details that I wouldn't
(and didn't really care to) understand. A few friends assured me that wouldn't be the
case with **Project Hail Mary**, and they were right. While the science is
present and likely well vetted (based on the acknowledgements), I found it easily
digestable. When the science did get a little lengthy for me (rarely) it was easy enough
to skim those passages and move on with the story. The story was fascinating, especially
the main character's arc, which had more than a few surprise twists. Well worth reading!
