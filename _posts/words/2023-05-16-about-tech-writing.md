I'm often asked "what does a technical writer do?" I usually respond by describing
where I work, the goals of my projects, the kind of work they entail, and how I spend
my time. But when I was asked to spend an hour discussing technical writing with a
group of university students participating in Google's
[Tech Exchange](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/tech-exchange)
program, I thought it might be time to put a little more thought into it and write
it down. Honestly, this article has been percolating in my mind for a while.

# What is technical writing

Before I describe the work of a technical writer or what their day might look like, let's
establish the purpose of technical writing. If you search "what is technical writing" you'll
find plenty of accurate and detailed descriptions, but I boil it down to the following.

> Technical writing is helping people understand complex ideas and technology.

This is what I always come back to when I'm explaining my work to someone. It's also
what led me to the discipline, pulling me away from software engineering. I enjoy
learning technologies and helping people; putting the two together was a turning
point in my career.

To break it down a bit further, technical writers spend much of their time doing the following.

*   Learning (often complex) technologies
*   Understanding how people will use those technologies
*   Explaining them in useful ways for the audience

# Skills of a technical writer

While I can (and will) describe a typical day in the life of a technical writer, I
think it's useful to first share the skills that one uses in their job. One of the
main reasons I switched from software engineering to technical writing is because
the skills I excelled at mapped to those most needed by technical writers.

*   **Communicate** - It's not just about the writing, although that is important
*   **Collaborate** - With people and teams across different disciplines (engineering,
    program management, product management, user experience, & more)
*   **Curiosity** - Always be learning
*   **Empathy** - Put yourself in your readers place
*   **Planning** - Plan the work
*   **Organization** - Work the plan
*   **Research** - Know where to find answers or who to ask
*   **Technical aptitude** - Able to understand, interpret, and explain concepts
    and instructions
*   **Practice, practice, practice** - Self explanatory :)

Now that you've read the list, let's go into a bit more detail about each of the skills.

> Education is not something you can finish. ~Isaac Asimov

## Communicate

As a philosophical-minded person, I feel strongly that communication is the
key to just about everything in life. If you consider your relationships, personal
or professional, their quality often hinges on how well the two of you communicate.
Communication is a skill—or set of skills—that can be learned, practiced, and
improved. Although we're writers by title and trade, technical writers need to
be able to communicate effectively across job disciplines, teams, and even companies,
using all the methods available to us.

## Collaborate

Technical writers often find ourselves collaborating across multiple disciplines
and can become the glue that brings people, ideas, and projects together. We
work closely with engineers to understand how the product works, user experience
researchers (UXR) to learn how people use the product, product managers to
know what product features are scheduled for the future, program managers to
know features' status and release dates, user experience writers (UXW) to
synchronize the technical documentation with the product labels and descriptions,
and more.

When we are collaborating with different disciplines across multiple teams,
the strength and effectiveness of those collaborative relationships have a
large impact on the projects.

## Curiosity

While some might describe curiosity as a personal characteristic, I think it's
also a skill that you can explicitly develop. The drive to understand how
something works can come from an interest in the subject matter, or it can come
from a prescribed expectation that you need to learn about something before
you can use it. Regardless of the reasoning, being curious serves a technical
writer well. When you're curious, you ask questions until you understand the
answers and that's key to successfully explaining complex technologies.

## Empathy

It's imperative that a technical writer understand the perspective of their
audience. By empathizing with our readers, understanding how they interact
with the product or technology, we bridge the gap between what people expect
and what they can do with the product.

## Planning

> Plan the work and work the plan. ~Unknown

Without a plan, you're herding cats. That doesn't mean you _must_ have a plan,
but it will make things easier throughout the project. There are several
variables and considerations when writing a technical document or set of docs.
Planning for those ahead of time allows you to focus on doing the tasks and
coordinating them, instead of figuring out what they are as you go.

I've worked through documentation projects both ways, with and without a plan.
Creating a plan ahead of time forced me to think through the goals, non-goals,
audience, use cases, architecture, tasks, and timelines, allowing me to be more
agile when things went awry—which they often do.

Here's a [doc plan template](https://todhilton.com/technicalwriting/doc-plan-template/)
that I created for myself and use regularly, which combined aspects I liked
from 5-6 other templates.

## Organization

This is the "work the plan" portion of the previous quote.




TODO
_An aside..._ We're often advised to _do what we love_ when it comes to choosing a
career, but I disagree with this sentiment. I prefer _do what you're good at_ and
your joy from the work will follow. Spend time understanding your skills, which ones are
strong or come to you more easily, and which ones your peers recognize and applaud.
Then map those skills to an industry you want to WORDS GO HERE

We each have strengths and weaknesses, things that seem to come
easier than others, and understanding those allows us to choose a profession
that maps to our strengths.

# Presentation slides

Meanwhile, here are the slides from a presentation I gave on May 17, 2023 to university students
participating in Google's [Tech Exchange](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/tech-exchange)
program. There are more explanations and resources listed in the speaker notes.
