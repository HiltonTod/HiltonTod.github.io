I'm often asked "what does a technical writer do?" and usually respond by describing
where I work, the goals of my projects, the kind of work they entail, and how I spend
my time. But when I was asked to spend an hour discussing technical writing with a
group of university students participating in Google's
[Tech Exchange](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/tech-exchange)
program, I thought it might be time to put a little more thought into it and write
it down. Honestly, this article has been percolating in my mind for quite some time.

These are my thoughts and opinions based on my years of experience as a tech writer.
Other writers are going to have different experiences and opinions, which I recommend
that you search out and read to give you a well-rounded understanding of the discipline.
You probably won't be surprised to discover that each of us has a slightly—sometimes
drastically—different perspective, but every one of them is valid and informative.

# Bio

When I attend or listen to a presentation, I'm always interested to know more about the
speaker and their experiences. Since this article is based on a presentation I gave to
university students, I'm including my biography slide.

As of this writing (June 2023), I have seven years experience as a technical writer,
and sixteen years before that as a systems engineer, team lead, software engineer
(developer), and software tester. My bachelors degree is in Accounting, which I
practiced for a few years before realizing it wasn't for me and switched to the
information technology (IT) field—this was inspired by my brother who had recently
left the U.S. Navy and began his career in IT.

# What is technical writing

Before I describe the work of a technical writer or what their day might look like, let's
establish the purpose of technical writing. If you search "what is technical writing" you'll
find plenty of accurate and detailed descriptions, but I boil it down to the following.

> Technical writing is helping people understand complex ideas and technology.

This is what I always come back to when I'm explaining my work to someone. It's also
what led me to the discipline, pulling me away from software engineering. I enjoy
learning technologies and helping people; putting the two together was a turning
point in my career.

To break it down a bit further, technical writers spend much of their time doing the following.

*   Learning (often complex) technologies
*   Understanding how people will use those technologies
*   Explaining them in useful ways for the audience

# Skills of a technical writer

I switched from software engineering to technical writing because the skills I excelled
at—and enjoyed—mapped to those most needed by technical writers.

*   **Communicate** - It's not just about the writing, although that is important
*   **Collaborate** - With people and teams across different disciplines (engineering,
    program management, product management, user experience, & more)
*   **Curiosity** - Always be learning
*   **Empathy** - Put yourself in your readers place
*   **Planning** - Plan the work
*   **Organization** - Work the plan
*   **Research** - Know where to find answers or who to ask
*   **Technical aptitude** - Able to understand, interpret, and explain concepts
    and instructions
*   **Practice, practice, practice** - Self explanatory :)

Now that you've read the list, let's go into a bit more detail about each of the skills.

> Education is not something you can finish. ~Isaac Asimov

## Communicate

As a philosophical-minded person, I feel strongly that communication is the
key to just about everything in life. If you consider your relationships, personal
or professional, their quality often hinges on how well the two of you communicate.

Communication is about more than words on a page and that's what makes it so
important for everyone, not only technical writers. It's a skill—or set of
skills—that can be learned, practiced, and improved. State your message clearly
and succinctly, while understanding your audience's perspective and preferences,
and do so in a timely manner depending on the situation. Those are merely the
basics of effective communication. 

Although we're writers by title and trade, technical writers need to be able to
communicate effectively across job disciplines, teams, and even companies, using
all the methods available to us.

## Collaborate

Technical writers often find ourselves collaborating across multiple disciplines
and can become the glue that brings people, ideas, and projects together. We
work closely with engineers to understand how the product works, user experience
researchers (UXR) to learn how people use the product, product managers to
know what product features are scheduled for the future, program managers to
know features' status and release dates, user experience writers (UXW) to
synchronize the technical documentation with the product labels and descriptions,
and more.

When we collaborate with different disciplines across multiple teams, the strength
and effectiveness of those relationships have a large impact on the projects.

> Collaboration depends on consideration. You have to extend your hand to the
> person you're working with. ~Dave Grohl (Off Camera with Sam Jones)

## Curiosity

While some might describe curiosity as a personal characteristic, I think it's
also a skill that you can explicitly develop. The drive to understand how
something works can come from an interest in the subject matter, or it can come
from a prescribed expectation that you need to learn about something before
you can use it. Regardless of the reasoning, being curious serves a technical
writer well.

When you're curious, you ask questions until you understand the answers and
that's key to successfully explaining complex technologies.

## Empathy

It's imperative that a technical writer understand the perspective of their
audience. By empathizing with our readers, understanding how they interact
with the product or technology, we bridge the gap between what people expect
and what they can do with the product.

## Planning

> Plan the work and work the plan. ~Unknown

Without a plan, you're herding cats. That doesn't mean you _must_ have a plan,
but it will make things easier throughout the project. There are several
variables and considerations when writing a technical document or set of docs.
Planning for those ahead of time allows you to focus on doing the tasks and
coordinating them, instead of figuring out what they are as you go.

I've worked through documentation projects both ways, with and without a plan.
Creating a plan ahead of time forced me to think through the goals, non-goals,
audience, use cases, architecture, tasks, timelines, and more, allowing me to
be more agile when things went awry—which they often do.

Here's a [doc plan template](https://todhilton.com/technicalwriting/doc-plan-template/)
that I created for myself and use regularly, which combines aspects I liked
from several other templates.

## Organization

This is the _work the plan_ portion of the previous quote. Similar to having a
plan, being organized allows you to focus on doing the tasks, creating the content,
and coordinating everything. Being organized also applies to your communication
with peers, partners, and stakeholders. Keeping up with and staying on top
of collaborative efforts with different people is challenging even when you're
organized. Without being organized, you're back to herding cats.

## Research

Akin to curiosity, research is a skill directly associated with a technical
writer's ability to learn technologies. Knowing where to find the answers
you need or who to ask for help drastically improves the efficiency of our
time. Research takes time, and that's expected to lead you down unintentional
or unproductive pathways at times, but you want to minimize those occurrences.
Having said that, sometimes those unexpected paths are the ones that yield
the most productive results...so don't arbitrarily limit your exploration.

## Technical aptitude

Although this skill is towards the end of the list, it's extremely important.
Let me be clear, I'm **not** referring to an ingrained talent to understand
technology, where you must be someone who _just gets it_. I firmly believe
that technical aptitude is a skill we can develop through curiosity, research,
exposure, and practice. Get in there with the product, feature, or technology,
do your best to understand it, and play around with it enough to build a
familiarity. Once you've done that, parts of what you learn will apply to other
technologies and help you learn them faster and more efficiently. Doing this,
you can develop and improve your technical aptitude over time.

## Practice, practice, practice

While this isn't necessarily a skill, it's imperative that you build the
habit of practicing the skills previously described. Like anything, the best
way to improve is to practice, whether it's your jumpshot or how well you
communicate with stakeholders. The more you do _it_, the easier _it_ will be and
the better you'll be at doing _it_. Practice and then practice some more!

# Day in the life

When I was an engineer and interested in switching disciplines, I asked a
friend who had 10 years of experience as a technical writer, "what do you do?"
Here's their answer:

> About one-third of my time is spent doing program management (PgM) work, another
> third with engineering (SWE) and testing work, and the remaining third is actually
> writing docs (TW). ~David Shevitz

Their description has stuck with me all these years. It's practical, succinct, and
accurate, especially for those of us in the software industry who are familiar with
each of the disciplines. Technical writers spend their time collaborating, engineering,
and writing.

## Collaborate (PgM)

As previously described in the skills section, [collaboration](#Collaborate) is
imperative to being successful as a technical writer. I'd posit that it's a
primary function of a program manager, hence the role comparison.

During a typical workday, that involves communicating openly and in a timely manner
with the subject matter experts, stakeholders, and other writers about the project's
status and any issues that arise. Technical writers work closely with engineers and
subject matter experts to gain a certain level of understanding of the product or
features. Like most, writers often have more requests and work than we can fit into
a regular day or week, which requires us to prioritize and manage the workload with
our peers and stakeholders.

## Engineer (SWE)

You might think that this functionality relies heavily—or even mostly—on
the [technical aptitude](#technical-aptitude) skill, but don't underestimate
the impact of [curiosity](#curiosity), [communication](#communicate),
[empathy](#empathy), and [research](#research).

Technical writers have to learn the technology, product, or feature well
enough to explain it to others. This often means interviewing engineers
and then testing the product yourself in a sandbox environment by writing
some code—perhaps with help from a SME. By going through this process,
writers gain an understanding of what customers will experience and how
to best explain it to them. We're often one of the first people using
the feature, finding bugs, and working through development hiccups, which
can translate into the documentation we create.

## Write (TW)

This might be surprising, but writing the document—or documentation set—is
often the last thing a technical writer does.

Before we can begin writing, we need to gain a sufficient understanding of
the technology and how to use it. During this initial timeframe, we'll
begin planning and organizing the work in a doc plan ([template](https://todhilton.com/technicalwriting/doc-plan-template/)),
based on estimates from collaborating with peers and stakeholders. As we
write the documentation, we'll follow style guides, adhere to company and
industry standards, and iterate on the content frequently based on feedback
and reviews from subject matter experts and other writers or editors.

The documentation we publish is the tip of the iceberg, with the program
management, engineering, and much of the writing work underneath the
metaphorical water, never to be seen by the readers.

# What I like about technical writing

When I finished my presentation to the [Tech Exchange](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/tech-exchange)
participants, I asked for feedback from a friend and fellow tech writer who
attended. They advised me to include what I like about technical writing and what
makes it fun, as we'd previously discussed, to help the audience understand more
about my motivation.

> I like writing. I like technology. Putting the two together was a no-brainer
> that took me 16 years to figure out.

First and foremost, the people are my favorite part of being a technical writer.
Honestly, I can say this about each position in my career, but, admittedly,
I feel a special connection with other writers, moreso than I did with engineers.
Writers typically value the skills that I previously outlined, often come from
unexpected professional backgrounds, encompass diverse personal life experiences,
and share a love for learning.

> Always be learning

Combining my curiosity with a job where I'm expected to learn new things is a
recipe for fun. While they call it work and not play for a reason—a phrase often
heard from my dad—I sincerely enjoy digging into something new and trying to
understand it as best I can. On a personal note, my curiosity and love of learning
is one of the reasons I'm an avid reader, which I strongly believe contributes to
my success as a technical writer.

> Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers. ~Harry S. Truman

It wasn't until later in my career that I realized how much I enjoy helping others.
I like knowing that my work helps someone get through a tough moment of their
code failing or providing that ah-ha moment when they finally understand a
complext concept. While it might not necessarily fit into the category of fun,
it's very rewarding and a large part of my motivation.

## Find joy in your work

Discussing what I like about technical writing brings up the concept of how
we feel about our work. Here's my personal theory on job satisfaction.

> To experience joy in your work, focus on the skills you enjoy and building your
> proficiency with them.

I prefer this philosophy to the advice we hear so often to _do what you love_, and
here's why:

*   The word _love_ has significant weight to it and can have a powerful impact
    on our emotional health. Attaching _love_ to our work can create emotional
    highs and lows that we have little control over and affect our work-life balance.
*   By focusing on our skills, learning, and improving them, we intrinsicly find joy
    in our behavior and accomplishments. Research over the last few decades has proven
    that this is a sustainable way to feel joy, instead of pursuing the ambiguous
    idea of happiness.
*   Words matter. I prefer to focus on joy instead of happiness. Joy is an inner
    feeling—usually associated with meaning or purpose—whereas happiness is an emotion.
    Joy can be constant, while happiness is temporary. 
*   Pragmatically speaking, skills are transferable between jobs, making role transitions
    more accessible to you over the length of your career. By focusing on your
    skills—especially the ones you enjoy—you can identify where they apply to all
    kinds of different jobs and industries, which opens up a world of opportunities.

# Q&A

Answers to questions I've frequently been asked about technical writing. Admittedly,
technical writers either love or hate the FAQ section of any doc set, so I know I'm
tempting fate by putting this here. :)

Keep in mind that the following answers are based on my experience writing
documentation for the software industry.

## How can I transition into technical writing?

**Write!** Find opportunities in your current position, job, or company to write
documentation and gain some experience while creating a portfolio. While doing so,
be sure to follow the suggestions in
[How can I improve my writing skills?](#how-can-I-improve-my-writing-skills).

**Focus on the skills!** Review the [skills of a technical writer](#skills-of-a-technical-writer)
and think about how you demonstrate them in your current role. Try to increase the
areas of your day-to-day work that use these skills so that you can speak to
them on your resume and during interviews.

**Create a portfolio!** If you're able to create documents as part of your
current role, determine if they can be shared publicly and included in your
writing portfolio. If only parts are confidential, you might try scrubbing
them of that information and sharing them publicly, but I recommend that you
error on the side of caution when doing so.

**Take a certification course!** Before I had official experience as a tech
writer, I often received the same reaction to my applications: come back
to us when you have a year or two of experience. I was able to get over this
hurdle by taking a certification course. Here are a few to investigate.
*   [Technical Writing Certificate Program](https://www.tomboloinstitute.com/courses/technical-writing/technical-writing-certificate-program/)
at the Tombolo Institute at Bellevue College
*   [UW Certificate in Professional Technical Writing](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/professional-technical-writing)
*   [UC Berkeley Certificate in Technical Communication](https://extension.berkeley.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=17211).

## How can I build a writing portfolio?

*   Include documentation you've written in your current role, per my recommendation
    in [How can I transition into technical writing?](#how-can-I-transition-into-technical-writing).
*   Think of a technical task or project you've done or want to do and document it. This
    is how I came up with the writing sample describing how to
    [upload and backup files to Amazon S3 with PowerShell](https://todhilton.com/technicalwriting/upload-backup-your-files-to-amazon-s3-with-powershell/).
*   Find an existing document and rewrite it. This is an opportunity to make changes
    to the content's flow, correct assumptions, and use your own tone of voice. It's
    also an opportunity to explain why you made the changes, while maintaining a positive
    attitude towards the original. Instead of saying "it sucked" try to point to objective
    reasons, such as "during my testing I discovered that they missed a crucial step" or
    "I had trouble understanding the analogy they used to explain the concept and wanted
    to try a different one." If you do this, state clearly that you're rewriting someone
    else's work so that the reviewers don't mistake it for your original writing.
*   If you have a side project, such as creating a mobile app, document it as though
    you're doing so for customers or your imagined team of engineers, product managers,
    and program managers.
*   Contribute to an open source project. Honestly, this is much more difficult than
    many realize. I received this advice, but I couldn't find a project that I understood,
    needed documentation, and had a clear entry point for me to contribute. The
    barrier to entry was too high, especially as an inexperienced writer.

## What should I include in my portfolio?

More isn't necessarily better. A reviewer or recruiter will have limited time
to review your portfolio, so you want to present the breadth of your experience
while keeping them to the point. I recommend that you include the following.

*   3-5 documents
*   Each document should be 5-10 pages in length
*   The set should include 2-3 of the following types of documents (with at least
    one or two of the ones recommended):
    *   [Recommend] How-to - a task-based set of instructions that arrive at a clear goal
    *   [Recommend] Conceptual - explains a technology
    *   [Recommend] Tutorial - how to complete a task from start to finish with guaranteed success 
    *   API library - how to use an API with a client library
    *   Best practices - provide recommendations for a common customer goal
    *   Quickstart - guidelines for creating or doing something new quickly
    *   Bulletin - an issue that needs to be publicized to customers or stakeholders
    *   Troubleshooting - guidelines for how to deal with a specific problem or issue
 
You can view my portfolio at [todhilton.com/technicalwriting](https://todhilton.com/technicalwriting/).

## How can I improve my writing skills?

Practice, practice, practice! And while you're practicing, do the following.

*   Familiarize yourself with industry best practices for things like grammar,
    punctuation, capitalization, formatting, abbreviations, accessibility,
    localization, and more.
*   Keep your writing clear, succinct, accurate, and use a conversational tone.
    Avoid wordy prose and making the tone too informal or formal, find a nice
    middle ground.
*   Understand how to follow a style guide, such as the
    [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
*   Discuss writing with other writers and editors. For example, check out
    the [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) communities.
*   Read your documents out loud. This might sound silly, but it's helpful
    when self-editing and trying to maintain a conversational tone.

## How can I get experience writing technical docs?

If you're transitioning from an existing role or job, see
[How can I transition into technical writing?](#how-can-I-transition-into-technical-writing).

If you don't have opportunities to write in your existing role, I recommend
reviewing the suggestions in
[How can I build a writing portfolio?](#how-can-i-build-a-writing-portfolio).

## Do I need to know how to code?

## What can engineers do to work better with tech writers?

## How does technical writing differ from the documentation work done by engineers?

_Here are a few fun personal questions from the presentation's attendees._

## Who's your favorite superhero?

Spiderman! Since I was a little kid, I've loved his ability to go anywhere
he wants using his bare hands and feet. As I grew older and better understood
his story, I loved that he was a nerdy teenager with an altruistic desire to
help people.

## What's your favorite comic book series?

There are so many good ones, but narrowing it down to a few I'd callout
[Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/series/146415-saga) (by Brian K. Vaughan & Fiona Staples),
[Monstress](https://www.goodreads.com/series/178016-monstress) (by Marjorie M. Liu & Sana Takeda),
and [Fables](https://www.goodreads.com/series/54621-fables-the-deluxe-edition) (by Bill Willingham).
