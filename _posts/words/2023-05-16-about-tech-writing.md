# Introduction

For eight years of my career, I was a software development engineer in test (SDET)

Several years ago, when I spent my days as a software development engineer in test (SDET), I was chatting
with a friend who was a technical writer. I had worked with people in the Help It was the first time I remember

During my years as a technical writer, I've often been asked various forms of "what does a technical writer
do?"

# What is technical writing

Before I describe the work of a technical writer or what their day might look like, let's
establish the purpose of technical writing. If you search "what is technical writing" you'll
find plenty of accurate and detailed descriptions, but I boil it down to the following.

`Technical writing is helping people understand complex ideas and technology.`

This is what I always come back to when I'm explaining my work to someone. I enjoy
helping people and learning technologies; putting the two together is what led me to
the technical writing discipline.

To break it down a bit further, technical writers spend much of their time doing the following.

*   Learning (often complex) technologies
*   Understanding how people will use those technologies
*   Explaining them in useful ways for the audience

# Skills of a technical writer

While I can (and will) describe a typical day in the life of a technical writer, I
think it's useful to first share the skills that a successful technical writer uses in
their job. One of the main reasons I switched from software engineering to technical
writing is because the skills I excelled at mapped to those most needed by technical
writers.

*   Communicate - It's not just about the writing, although that is important
*   Collaborate - With people and teams in different disciplines (engineering,
    program management, user experience, & more)
*   Curiosity - Always be learning
*   Empathy - Put yourself in your readers place
*   Planning - Plan the work
*   Organization - Work the plan
*   Research - Know where to find answers or who to ask
*   Technical aptitude - Able to interpret and explain concepts and instructions
*   Practice, practice, practice - Self explanatory :)

Now that you've read the list, let's go into a bit more detail about each of the skills.

## Communicate

As a somewhat philosophical-minded person, I feel strongly that communication is the
key to just about everything in life. 




<todo>
_An aside..._ We're often advised to _do what we love_ when it comes to choosing a
career, but I disagree with this sentiment. I prefer _do what you're good at_ and
your joy from the work will follow. Spend time understanding your skills, which ones are
strong or come to you more easily, and which ones your peers recognize and applaud.
Then map those skills to an industry you want to WORDS GO HERE

We each have strengths and weaknesses, things that seem to come
easier than others, and understanding those allows us to choose a profession
that maps to our strengths.

# Presentation slides

Meanwhile, here are the slides from a presentation I gave on May 17, 2023 to university students
participating in Google's [Tech Exchange](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/tech-exchange)
program. There are more explanations and resources listed in the speaker notes.
