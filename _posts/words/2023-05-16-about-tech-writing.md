I'm often asked "what does a technical writer do?" and usually respond by describing
where I work, the goals of my projects, the kind of work they entail, and how I spend
my time. But when I was asked to spend an hour discussing technical writing with a
group of university students participating in Google's
[Tech Exchange](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/tech-exchange)
program, I thought it might be time to put a little more thought into it and write
it down. Honestly, this article has been percolating in my mind for quite some time.

These are my thoughts and opinions based on my years of experience as a tech writer.
Other writers are going to have different experiences and opinions, which I recommend
that you search out and read to give you a well-rounded understanding of the discipline.

# Bio

When I attend or listen to a presentation, I'm always interested to know more about the
speaker and their experiences. Since this article is based on a presentation I gave to
university students, I'm including my biography slide with a few more details, including
some personal interests.

As of this writing (June 2023), I have seven years experience as a technical writer,
and sixteen years before that as a systems engineer, team lead, software engineer
(developer), and software tester. My bachelors degree is in Accounting, which I
practiced for a few years before realizing it wasn't for me and switched to the
information technology (IT) field—this was inspired by my brother who had recently
left the U.S. Navy and began his career in IT.

# What is technical writing

Before I describe the work of a technical writer or what their day might look like, let's
establish the purpose of technical writing. If you search "what is technical writing" you'll
find plenty of accurate and detailed descriptions, but I boil it down to the following.

> Technical writing is helping people understand complex ideas and technology.

This is what I always come back to when I'm explaining my work to someone. It's also
what led me to the discipline, pulling me away from software engineering. I enjoy
learning technologies and helping people; putting the two together was a turning
point in my career.

To break it down a bit further, technical writers spend much of their time doing the following.

*   Learning (often complex) technologies
*   Understanding how people will use those technologies
*   Explaining them in useful ways for the audience

# Skills of a technical writer

One of the main reasons I switched from software engineering to technical writing is
because the skills I excelled at—and enjoyed—mapped to those most needed by technical
writers.

*   **Communicate** - It's not just about the writing, although that is important
*   **Collaborate** - With people and teams across different disciplines (engineering,
    program management, product management, user experience, & more)
*   **Curiosity** - Always be learning
*   **Empathy** - Put yourself in your readers place
*   **Planning** - Plan the work
*   **Organization** - Work the plan
*   **Research** - Know where to find answers or who to ask
*   **Technical aptitude** - Able to understand, interpret, and explain concepts
    and instructions
*   **Practice, practice, practice** - Self explanatory :)

Now that you've read the list, let's go into a bit more detail about each of the skills.

> Education is not something you can finish. ~Isaac Asimov

## Communicate

As a philosophical-minded person, I feel strongly that communication is the
key to just about everything in life. If you consider your relationships, personal
or professional, their quality often hinges on how well the two of you communicate.
Communication is a skill—or set of skills—that can be learned, practiced, and
improved. Although we're writers by title and trade, technical writers need to
be able to communicate effectively across job disciplines, teams, and even companies,
using all the methods available to us.

## Collaborate

Technical writers often find ourselves collaborating across multiple disciplines
and can become the glue that brings people, ideas, and projects together. We
work closely with engineers to understand how the product works, user experience
researchers (UXR) to learn how people use the product, product managers to
know what product features are scheduled for the future, program managers to
know features' status and release dates, user experience writers (UXW) to
synchronize the technical documentation with the product labels and descriptions,
and more.

When we collaborate with different disciplines across multiple teams, the strength
and effectiveness of those relationships have a large impact on the projects.

> Collaboration depends on consideration. You have to extend your hand to the
> person you're working with. ~Dave Grohl (Off Camera with Sam Jones)

## Curiosity

While some might describe curiosity as a personal characteristic, I think it's
also a skill that you can explicitly develop. The drive to understand how
something works can come from an interest in the subject matter, or it can come
from a prescribed expectation that you need to learn about something before
you can use it. Regardless of the reasoning, being curious serves a technical
writer well.

When you're curious, you ask questions until you understand the answers and
that's key to successfully explaining complex technologies.

## Empathy

It's imperative that a technical writer understand the perspective of their
audience. By empathizing with our readers, understanding how they interact
with the product or technology, we bridge the gap between what people expect
and what they can do with the product.

## Planning

> Plan the work and work the plan. ~Unknown

Without a plan, you're herding cats. That doesn't mean you _must_ have a plan,
but it will make things easier throughout the project. There are several
variables and considerations when writing a technical document or set of docs.
Planning for those ahead of time allows you to focus on doing the tasks and
coordinating them, instead of figuring out what they are as you go.

I've worked through documentation projects both ways, with and without a plan.
Creating a plan ahead of time forced me to think through the goals, non-goals,
audience, use cases, architecture, tasks, timelines, and more, allowing me to
be more agile when things went awry—which they often do.

Here's a [doc plan template](https://todhilton.com/technicalwriting/doc-plan-template/)
that I created for myself and use regularly, which combines aspects I liked
from several other templates.

## Organization

This is the _work the plan_ portion of the previous quote. Similar to having a
plan, being organized allows you to focus on doing the tasks, creating the content,
and coordinating everything. Being organized also applies to your communication
with peers, partners, and stakeholders. Keeping up with and staying on top
of collaborative efforts with different people is challenging even when you're
organized. Without being organized, you're back to herding cats.

## Research

Akin to curiosity, research is a skill directly associated with a technical
writer's ability to learn technologies. Knowing where to find the answers
you need or who to ask for help drastically improves the efficiency of our
time. Research takes time, and that's expected to lead you down unintentional
or unproductive pathways at times, but you want to minimize those occurrences.
Having said that, sometimes those unexpected paths are the ones that yield
the most productive results...so don't arbitrarily limit your exploration.

## Technical aptitude

Although this skill is towards the end of the list, it's extremely important.
Let me be clear, I'm **not** referring to an ingrained talent to understand
technology, where you must be someone who _just gets it_. I firmly believe
that technical aptitude is a skill we can develop through curiosity, research,
exposure, and practice. Get in there with the product, feature, or technology,
do your best to understand it, and play around with it enough to build a
familiarity. Once you've done that, parts of what you learn will apply to other
technologies and help you learn them faster and more efficiently. Doing this,
you can develop and improve your technical aptitude over time.

## Practice, practice, practice

While this isn't necessarily a skill, it's imperative that you build the
habit of practicing the skills previously described. Like anything, the best
way to improve is to practice, whether it's your jumpshot or how well you
communicate with stakeholders. The more you do _it_, the easier _it_ will be and
the better you'll be at doing _it_. Practice and then practice some more!

# Day in the life

When I was an engineer and interested in switching disciplines, I asked a friend
of mine who had 10 years of experience as a technical writer, "what do you do?"
Here's their answer:

> About one-third of my time is spent doing program management (PgM) work, another
> third with engineering (SWE) and testing work, and the remaining third is actually
> writing docs (TW).

Their description has stuck with me all these years. It's practical, succinct, and
accurate, especially for those of us in the software industry who are familiar with
each of the disciplines. Technical writers spend their time collaborating, engineering,
and writing.

## Collaborate (PgM)

As previously described in the skills section, [collaboration](#Collaborate) is
imperative to being successful as a technical writer. I'd posit that it's a
primary function of a program manager, hence the role comparison.

During a typical workday, that involves communicating openly and in a timely manner
with the subject matter experts, stakeholders, and other writers about the project's
status and any issues that arise. Technical writers work closely with engineers and
subject matter experts to gain a certain level of understanding of the product or
features. Like most, writers often have more requests and work than we can fit into
a regular day or week, which requires us to prioritize and manage the workload with
our peers and stakeholders.

## Engineer (SWE)

You might think that this functionality relies heavily—or even mostly—on
the [technical aptitude](#Technical-aptitude) skill, but don't underestimate
the impact of [curiosity](#Curiosity), [communication](#Communicate),
[empathy](#Empathy), and [research](#Research).

Technical writers have to learn the technology, product, or feature well
enough to explain it to others. This often means interviewing engineers
and then testing the product yourself in a sandbox environment by writing
some code—perhaps with help from a SME. By going through this process,
writers gain an understanding of what customers will experience and how
to best explain it to them. We're often one of the first people using
the feature, finding bugs, and working through development hiccups, which
can translate into the documentation we create.

## Write (TW)

This might be surprising, but writing the document—or documentation set—is
often the last thing a technical writer does.

Before we can begin writing, we need to gain a sufficient understanding of
the technology and how to use it. During this initial timeframe, we'll
begin planning and organizing the work in a doc plan ([template](https://todhilton.com/technicalwriting/doc-plan-template/)),
based on estimates from collaborating with peers and stakeholders. As we
write the documentation, we'll follow style guides, adhere to company and
industry standards, and iterate frequently based on feedback and reviews
from subject matter experts and other writers or editors.

The documentation we publish is the tip of the iceberg, with the program
management, engineering, and much of the writing underneath the water, never
to be seen by the readers.

# What I like about technical writing

When I finished my presentation to the [Tech Exchange](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/tech-exchange)
participants, I asked for feedback from a friend and co-worker of mine who attended.
They were a fellow technical writer at Google for 3 of my years with Cloud and
said they missed hearing what I like about being a tech writer.

> I like writing. I like technology. Putting the two together was a no-brainer
> that took me 16 years to figure out.

First and foremost, the people are my favorite part of being a technical writer.
In my experience, the discipline seems to attract
