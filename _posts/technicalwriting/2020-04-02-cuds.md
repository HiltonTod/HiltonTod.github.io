_Before reading..._

-   _Target Audience:_ This doc set is geared towards the individuals responsible
    for managing the billing aspects of Google Cloud customers. The group is 
    commonly referred to as FinOps (Financial Operations) and their familiarity
    with technology can vary significantly, depending on their individual role,
    from (less technical) administrators, accountants, and data analysts to (more
    technical) developers and engineers.
-   _Scenario:_ The customers are interested in receiving discounts for the Google Cloud
    products they're currently purchasing and become aware of committed use discounts (CUDs).
    This doc set explains what CUDs are, how they work, how to sign up for them, and
    how to interpret or analyze the results in their billing cost reports.
-   _Sources:_ I wrote 90% of the content and edited the 10% that previously existed,
    with peer writers providing feedback and suggested edits through the review
    process. The information was derived from regular meetings with Technical Program
    Managers (TPM) and engineers. I tested the steps and processess in pre-release
    versions/environments.

_...and here are the samples._

The current version of the following documents are available at [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/docs/cuds).
Because the content will continue to evolve, I've captured the work I did in the following
PDF files. Additionally, because "print to PDF" removes much of a web site's styling, I've
included screenshot images of how the page looked at the time it was published.
